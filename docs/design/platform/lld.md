# Platform: Low-Level Design

Implements [HLD](./hld.md) v1.2 (draft; v1.0 was approved 2026-10-05, and v1.1/v1.2 move stage 0 to the owner's laptop). Decisions are cited as **D-n** and journeys as **J-n** from the HLD; this document doesn't restate their rationale.

## Scope boundary

This LLD covers **everything modules build on, plus infrastructure stage 0**. Since HLD v1.1, stage 0 is the owner's **Windows laptop**: Docker Desktop with the WSL2 backend, phone access over Tailscale, and no off-site backups.

**In scope:**
- the shared server libraries;
- the platform-owned tables;
- the contract package and client generation;
- the monorepo and the clean-up (D-34);
- the web and Android skeletons, including Android's build-time API base URL (F-264);
- test tooling and CI;
- the development database workflow and the release-migration tooling the first release needs;
- the **stage-0 laptop stack**: images, the laptop's Compose files and configuration, `budmon-local`, local secret files, the Google Cloud bootstrap, and the Windows/WSL2 and Tailscale setup (runbook `infra/runbooks/stage0-laptop.md`);
- the release rehearsal (D-41) in its stage-0 shape.

**In scope because the stage rule requires them from day one** (HLD D-29 rules 1 to 3):
- proxy support wired into every client (§4.10);
- worker-capture's own `capture-db` network with TLS `verify-full` to `db.budmon.internal`;
- the Postgres image's boot safeguards, with pgBackRest installed (unused on the laptop);
- strict host-role secret separation and SCRAM verifiers, including F-92's previous-password fallback;
- the gate commands that ship in the server image (the `api-secrets` re-wrap, `restore:verify`, `erasure:replay`);
- real Google Cloud KMS in production configuration.

**Out of scope (a separate stage-1 LLD, written before the first invitation)** (HLD D-29 rule 4 and gate):
- the choice of provider and the two servers;
- the WireGuard tunnel, cloud-init and OpenTofu for servers;
- deploy bundles, the bootstrap with trust anchors, the forced-command SSH deploys and the capture deploy channel;
- release signing, the tag ruleset, the GitHub App, the `tagging`/`tag-approval`/`production` environments and the `repo-guards` job (the v0.5 design is carried there as input);
- the server-topology rehearsal;
- infrastructure-only releases;
- SOPS secret sets and `budmonctl` rotation commands;
- D-40 encryption at rest and unlock;
- the egress proxy and host firewall rules;
- pgBackRest scheduling and restore drills;
- Alloy, Grafana Cloud and alert rules;
- the 15 gate procedures.

Nothing in that list changes application code (D-29 rule 2).

## Changelog

| Version | Date | Change |
| ------- | ---- | ------ |
| 0.1     | 2026-10-05 | Initial draft. |
| 0.2     | 2026-10-05 | Plan review round 1, **P-1** (signing identity): tags are pushed by a new `tag.yml` with a GitHub App token. `release.yml` runs only on tag pushes, signs only after the rehearsal passes, and verifies the real signatures with the production anchors before deploying. The anchors' refs are justified (F-174). The rehearsal signs copies in a local registry under its own identity, and TP-16.9 and TP-16.10 test real signatures and the regexes. |
| 0.2     | 2026-10-05 | **P-2** (role passwords): utility statements are built with `escapeIdentifier`/`escapeLiteral`, run with tracing suppressed, and `pg_stat_statements.track_utility = off` (F-14, F-15, F-170, test container). TP-2.10 checks spans, logs and `pg_stat_statements` for the canary. |
| 0.2     | 2026-10-05 | **P-3** (migrator rotation): F-92 falls back once to `DB_PASSWORD_PREVIOUS` (new config `DB_PASSWORD_PREVIOUS_FILE`). F-191 keeps the previous migrator password, refuses a second rotation until `budmonctl secrets clear-previous`, and documents the ordering. The rehearsal now rotates `budmon_capture`, `budmon_app` and `budmon_migrator` (step 11). TP-15.11 is extended. |
| 0.2     | 2026-10-05 | **P-4** (readiness under maintenance): F-172 step 7 checks the API directly (`healthcheck.js --ready` via `docker compose exec`), not through Caddy. TP-15.8 adds a queue-upgrade case. |
| 0.2     | 2026-10-05 | **P-5** (telemetry noise): F-40 classifies drops as `expected` (a declared instrumentation list) or `unexpected`, with label `drop_kind`; only `unexpected` alerts (DV-1, §7.5). F-36 adds a metric View allowlist for every instrument. TP-3.7 is updated; TP-3.11 and TP-4.21 are new. |
| 0.2     | 2026-10-05 | **P-6** (slices): S-15 is split into S-15a, S-15b and S-15c, and S-11 into S-11a and S-11b (S-13 suggestion). Canaries move to `@budmon/test-support` (F-198, delivered in S-3), and the Sentry capture endpoint becomes F-194. S-15a depends on S-11b; S-16 depends on S-11b and S-13. Test-case slice labels are updated. |
| 0.2     | 2026-10-05 | **P-7** (inherited grants): `pg_read_all_data` and `pg_monitor` are granted `WITH INHERIT TRUE`; the migrator gets `pg_monitor WITH ADMIN` from cluster bootstrap so it can grant it on. §3.3, F-14 and F-15 now agree. TP-2.20 is new. |
| 0.2     | 2026-10-05 | Suggestions: **S-1** a provisional conversion of a past date also enqueues a backfill (F-132, TP-9.5b). **S-2** `fx` is built for every worker role (F-96). **S-3** body handling between Fastify and oRPC is specified, with a fallback (F-55, TP-4.19). **S-4** F-79 writes `/tmp/heartbeat` through an injected writer (TP-6.10). **S-5** Caddy has a fixed address and is the only trusted proxy (`TRUSTED_PROXY` in `prod-s0.env`, TP-5.10). **S-6** `unavailable` kinds for non-envelope 502/503/504, and 503 `unknown` maps to the "couldn't confirm" message (F-202, F-203, F-252). **S-7** Android 401 keeps entries pending; `SENDING` resets on start (F-255, TP-13.5). **S-8** the sequence number is `release.yml`'s `GITHUB_RUN_NUMBER`, with a full-history checkout (F-185). **S-9** distinct UIDs per service (F-172, F-175). **S-10** pgBackRest connects as `budmon_admin` over the socket with a peer mapping (`pg_ident.conf`, §7.4). **S-11** merge-back check F-6b (TP-14.9). **S-12** new cases TP-2.19, TP-4.20, TP-9.18, TP-11.29, TP-13.14, TP-13.15. **S-13** S-11 split. None declined. Q-1 (FX before 2024-03-02) added to §11 for the user. |
| 0.3     | 2026-10-05 | Plan review round 2, **P-1** (restricted tag creation): a repository ruleset restricts creating, updating and deleting `refs/tags/v*` to a single bypass actor, the GitHub App `budmon-release-tagger` (no users or admins). The App has `contents: write` on this repository only. Its private key lives only in the `tagging` environment, whose branch policy is `main` only. `tag.yml` always runs from `main` and verifies the release PR, or the owner-approved, green hotfix/infra PR, before tagging that exact SHA. TP-16.8 now checks the ruleset and the environment through a `repo-guards` job, and the first-deploy runbook sets them up. |
| 0.3     | 2026-10-05 | **S-1:** Postgres starts with `-c ident_file=/etc/budmon/pg_ident.conf` (mounted from the bundle), the same arguments everywhere. `ADMIN_PASSWORD` is explained (required by `initdb`, never used for login). New TP-15.1b covers peer login and `pgbackrest check` as OS user `postgres`. **S-2:** `seq = GITHUB_RUN_NUMBER + RELEASE_SEQ_OFFSET`, with a rename runbook; TP-14.6b added. **S-3:** the rehearsal copies by digest with `crane copy` and asserts digests are unchanged; `rehearse` has `id-token: write`; `verify-signature` checks its digest list equals `build`'s outputs that `rehearse` received and `sign` signed. **S-4:** `budmon-deploy status` and the deploy log report a pending `clear-previous` (TP-15.7b). None declined. |
| 0.4     | 2026-10-05 | Plan review round 3, **P-1** (self-approval): a hotfix/infra tag is approved through a new `tag-approval` environment (required reviewer: the owner, "prevent self-review" off; the user said "i don't mind you approving ur own request"), because GitHub doesn't allow approving one's own pull request. `tag.yml` gains an `approve` job on the dispatch path, and `tag` re-checks that the PR head SHA hasn't changed. The verify logic moves into F-186 `verifyTagRequest` (PR open, base `main`, branch name, checks green, head SHA recorded), with TP-16.11. TP-16.8's `repo-guards` also checks `tag-approval`'s reviewer and its prevent-self-review setting. |
| 0.4     | 2026-10-05 | **S-1:** residual risk stated: the owner's account can change the ruleset and environments, mitigated by hardware-key 2FA and detection by `repo-guards` (hourly, on pushes to `main`, on demand; a failure opens a `security` issue and GitHub emails the owner). **S-2:** F-186 requires the hotfix/infra head to descend from the last successful production deployment's tag, and computes the infra-only diff against that tag; new `hotfix.md` runbook line: never "Update branch" before tagging. None declined. |
| 0.5     | 2026-10-05 | Plan review of v0.4 (ready for the user) suggestions applied; status set to `in-review`. **S-1:** `tag.yml`'s `approve` job (environment `tag-approval`) now runs on the release path too, so every tag needs an explicit owner click. Agents act under the owner's account, so a merged `release/*` PR alone no longer leads to a signed release. The cost is one click per release; **the user can drop this** (back to approval on the hotfix/infra path only) if it's not wanted. **S-2:** the residual-risk paragraph names the credentials agents must never hold (fine-grained tokens without "Deployments", "Administration", "Environments" or "Secrets"; no classic or OAuth `repo` tokens), and the first-deploy runbook adds the step. **S-3:** F-186 counts only `production` deployments created by `github-actions[bot]` from a `release.yml` push run with a tag-shaped ref; hand-made records are ignored; TP-16.11 adds cases (i) and (j). None declined. |
| 0.6     | 2026-10-07 | **HLD v1.1 (stage 0 on the owner's Windows laptop)**; status back to `draft`. **Out of scope, moved to a future stage-1 LLD:** S-15a/b/c and S-16's server parts: deploy bundles, bootstrap and trust anchors (F-171, F-174), deploy steps (F-172), host-side `budmonctl` (F-173), cloud-init, host units and OpenTofu (F-176, F-177), the egress proxy, Alloy, pgBackRest scheduling, alert rules, SOPS secret sets and `rotate-role`/`init-deployment` (old F-191, F-192), `verifyTagRequest` (F-186), the stage-0 server overlay (F-199), `release.yml`, signing, the tag ruleset, the GitHub App, the `tagging`/`tag-approval`/`production` environments and `repo-guards`; tests TP-14.6b, TP-15.4 to TP-15.10, TP-15.12, TP-15.14, TP-15.15, TP-16.8 to TP-16.11 removed with them. **Added for stage 0:** `.gitattributes`; `infra/local/` (laptop Compose for `budmon-main` and `budmon-capture`, Caddy on `127.0.0.1:8080` with `auto_https off`, `pg_hba`) (F-175); `budmon-local` install/upgrade/rollback/restore with local pre-upgrade dumps (F-178); `gcp-bootstrap.sh` (F-179); `initLocalSecrets` (F-191) and F-11's placeholder rule; the FX gap check job and its start-up enqueue (F-139, F-78); the Android API base URL property (F-264); `tools/ci/tagRelease.sh` and a stage-0 `tag.yml` using `GITHUB_TOKEN`; `cli diagnostics:sentry-test` (F-93); config `GOOGLE_OAUTH_REDIRECT_ORIGIN` (§4.2, TP-2.21), so the Gmail redirect can be `http://localhost:8080` while `PUBLIC_ORIGIN` is the Tailscale name (HLD A-16); runbook `infra/runbooks/stage0-laptop.md`; §7.4 to §7.7 stage notes (B2 for exports and erasure log only, Sentry e-mails only, Tailscale, no registry). **Changed:** F-185 is now `buildNumber` from `git rev-list --count`; F-195 rehearsal runs the laptop topology (14 steps, including the migrator previous-password fallback and worker-capture's network isolation); F-170 has `archive_mode = off`; the health-check entry moved into F-175. **Slices:** S-15a/b/c and S-16 replaced by S-15 (stage-0 laptop stack) and S-16 (release rehearsal, stage-0 shape); S-9, S-13, S-14 extended. **Tests:** TP-2.21, TP-9.19, TP-9.20, TP-13.16, TP-14.10, TP-15.20 to TP-15.23, TP-15.25, TP-15.26, TP-16.12 added; TP-14.6, TP-15.1b, TP-15.3, TP-15.11, TP-15.13, TP-15.16 to TP-15.18, TP-16.3, TP-16.7 rewritten. **Open questions:** Q-2 (approval click) recorded as deferred to stage 1. **Q-1 resolved** as (a) "no rate" before 2024-03-02, extendable by amendment; Q-2 stays deferred to the stage-1 LLD and is the only remaining entry in §11. |
| 0.7     | 2026-10-07 | Plan review of v0.6 (round 1, REVISE). **P-1 (first install):** (a) F-178 defines the `BUDMON_HOME` layout with owners and modes: each service's secret directory belongs to its container UID (api 10001, worker-general 10002, worker-capture 10003, migrate 10004, postgres 999; dirs 0500, files 0400) through `apply_secret_ownership`; `pg/` is 999:999 0700; F-191 now writes 0600/0700 files as the WSL user, with an `.initialised` marker; a permission probe (exit 21). (b) `install` is resumable: secrets first, then a placeholder check that stops with exit 20; F-179 refuses until secrets and `site.env` exist and writes through the new `budmon-local secret set` (stdin → `sudo install -o <uid> -m 0400`), which is also used for every placeholder and the service-account key. (c) F-175 defines the complete laptop environment: `local.env` gains `KMS_PROVIDER`, `FX_PROVIDER`, `OBJECT_STORE_KIND`, DB settings; a `site.env` table (`PUBLIC_ORIGIN`, `CAPTURE_KEY_VERSION` from F-179, `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`, `S3_*`, `SENTRY_DSN`) with prompts; `BUDMON_RELEASE=${BUDMON_TAG}`; per-service users and `*_FILE` paths; F-11's placeholder rule also covers plain variables. Tests: TP-15.22, TP-15.23 rewritten; TP-15.27 (Compose environment through `loadConfig`, complete and per missing key) and TP-15.28 (`secret set`) added; rehearsal step 1 applies the same ownership. **P-2:** Android debug builds default to the development stack (`http://10.0.2.2:5173/`, the Vite dev server proxying `/api` and `/health` to the development API; F-22) and can't be pointed at port 8080 (F-264, TP-13.16). **P-3:** `budmon-local` copies each tag's `infra/local/` into `releases/<tag>/`, runs every command from `state.current`'s copy (re-execution rule, exit 3), continues an upgrade from the new tag's copy (`_upgrade-continue`), rolls back with the previous copy, and refuses a copy that differs from the tag (exit 12) (TP-15.20, TP-15.21). **Suggestions:** S-1 one hotfix naming rule (§4.17 "Stage-0 tagging", TP-14.10); S-2 `wslconfig.example` leaves mirrored networking commented out, `adb` on Windows; S-3 stage-0 stale-connection Sentry event as a requirement on `sources` (§7.5); S-5 S-16's criterion states same inputs, not byte-identical images; S-6 F-22 uses `-p budmon-dev`; S-7 `restore` recreates the database and restores together with the dump's release (`state.current` set to it); S-8 `diagnostics:sentry-test` uses F-34's `report`; S-9 weekly Gmail reconnect in the runbook and brief. S-4 is HLD-only. Also added: §10.1 "What the build environment can and can't test". |
| 0.8     | 2026-10-07 | Plan review of v0.7 (round 2, REVISE). **P-1 (destructive restore):** F-178 `restore` now validates the dump first (`pg_restore --list` with `public` and `pgboss` tables; exit 14), requires a running Postgres (exit 18), takes a safety dump `<ts>_<current>_pre-restore.dump` (never pruned; exit 19 on failure), restores into `budmon_restore` and runs the dump's release `migrate` and `restore:verify` there while the live database keeps serving, and only then switches by renaming (`budmon` → `budmon_old_<ts>`, `budmon_restore` → `budmon`) under maintenance. A readiness failure renames back and restarts the current release. On every failure the current database stays in place and the safety dump's path is printed. Old databases are dropped by the next successful upgrade. `pg_hba` admits `budmon_migrator` to `budmon_restore`. TP-15.22 gains invalid, truncated and half-failing dumps, which leave the original data readable, plus readiness rollback; TP-15.3 extended. **Suggestions:** S-1 hotfix merge-backs use merge commits (repository setting, runbook, §4.17), and `restore` skips the ancestry check for a tag with a matching local tag and release copy; S-2 `install.inprogress` marker lets a failed first install resume (TP-15.22 (d2), (d3)); S-3 dump pruning matches only regular dump names; S-4 the emulator-to-development path added to TP-15.17 and §10.1, bats-core v1.12.0 (with bats-support v0.3.0 and bats-assert v2.1.0) pinned through `infra/local/test/setup-bats.sh`, and TP-15.28 runs `secret set` once for real with `sudo` and Docker. Runbook: broken-cluster procedure. |
| 0.9     | 2026-10-07 | Plan review round 3: READY-FOR-USER, no blocking findings; status set to `in-review`. Suggestions applied in F-178 `restore`: **S-1** the database-level statements of F-14 (`REVOKE ALL ON DATABASE … FROM PUBLIC`) are re-applied to `budmon_restore` after `pg_restore`, and `migrate` grants `CONNECT` back; **S-2** `ALLOW_CONNECTIONS false` before terminating backends, up to 3 terminate-and-rename attempts (exit 24), `ALLOW_CONNECTIONS true` after the renames and on the rollback path; **S-3** a free-space check before creating `budmon_restore` (exit 23); **S-4** `restore:verify` runs as the `migrate` service (`budmon_migrator`) with `DB_NAME=budmon_restore` (F-93, F-178); **S-5** `setup-bats.sh` pins bats-core, bats-support and bats-assert by verified commit SHA and refuses a mismatch. TP-15.22 extended ((h5) to (h7), privilege and role assertions in (I1)). |
| 0.10    | 2026-10-07 | Implementation-time amendments A-1 to A-6 from the approved identity HLD v0.5 §5.6 (PA-1 to PA-6): `Principal.sessionId` and `testPrincipal`; Mailpit in the laptop stack with worker-general email configuration, prompts and the rehearsal's email and Mailpit checks; Google sign-in configuration, the recovery-code key ring and the Android `budmon.googleServerClientId` property (F-265); the Google callback as the one exception to D-24 rule 4; stage-1 egress notes (§7.8); `identity:bootstrap-owner` in F-93 and the `budmon-local bootstrap-owner` wrapper. Tests added: TP-2.22, TP-2.23, TP-13.17, TP-15.29, TP-16.13; changed: TP-4.16, TP-15.13, TP-15.23, TP-15.27. A-2 and A-4 change the HLD (v1.3) and need user confirmation. Status stays `approved`. |
| 0.9     | 2026-10-07 | **Approved.** Approved on the owner's behalf by the main conversation, under the owner's direct instruction on 2026-10-07: "auto approve the hlds as well just keep going man. I want you to skip the human in the loop (me) and just keep going" (and earlier: "auto approve the lld and start building right away"). Plan review passed. No content change. |
| 0.11    | 2026-10-07 | Implementation-time amendments A-7 to A-9, raised by the test-architect while writing the S-0 tests. **A-7:** F-6's CLI runs `tools/ci/checkMigrationFiles.ts` (the `@budmon/tools-ci` sources sit at the package root, no `src/`; F-185's CLI line corrected the same way); the CLI takes `--branch`, `--changed-files` and `--hotfix-merge-back`, parsed by new exported functions; `ci.yml`'s `migrations` job (from S-0) supplies them from `github.head_ref`, a `git diff --no-renames --name-only origin/<base_ref>...HEAD` file and the PR labels, through `env`; TP-0.17 and TP-0.19 added. **A-8:** §10.1 uses a root `vitest.config.ts` with `test.projects` and `passWithNoTests` instead of `vitest.workspace.ts` (removed in Vitest 4); pins unchanged (Vitest 5.0.3, TypeScript 5.9.3). **A-9:** `.gitattributes` moves from S-15 to S-0 with its exact content in §2.2; TP-0.18 added. Approval stands. |
| 0.12    | 2026-10-07 | Implementation-time amendments A-10 to A-21, raised by the software-engineer, the code-reviewer and the test-architect after S-0. **A-10:** F-3 checks only non-relative (package) specifiers, by package name matching `/icon/i`, in imports, re-exports and literal dynamic imports; relative imports are never reported except `.svg` files outside `ui/icons/`; TP-11.19 rewritten. **A-11:** the service layering rule's `files` are `apps/server/src/*/*Service.ts` and `apps/server/src/platform/*/*Service.ts`; TP-0.2 rewritten with full paths. **A-12:** `formatjs/enforce-id` is removed (the catalog uses explicit dotted IDs, which the hash pattern rejects, and the rule's hash path calls `context.getFilename()`, which ESLint 10 removed); new rule F-3b `budmon/message-id` requires a literal ID matching the ID grammar; F-1 sets `settings.formatjs.additionalFunctionNames: ["t"]` and F-9 extracts with `--additional-function-names t`; TP-11.30 added. **A-13:** ESLint 10.12.0 stays; `eslint-plugin-formatjs` pinned to 8.1.1 (peer `9 || 10`; code review G-1: 5.4.2 crashes under ESLint 10); `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` 6.10.2 pinned exactly, its ESLint 9 peer widened to 10 by a single `pnpm-workspace.yaml` `peerDependencyRules.allowedVersions` entry; TP-0.20 and TP-0.22 (web-rule smoke lint) added, TP-11.21 and TP-11.22 also assert no rule throws. **A-14:** new §2.2.2 lists every root script with its command and owning slice (`dev`, `db:reset`, `db:seed`, `db:migrate` in S-2; `contract:openapi` in S-4; `stylelint.config.js`, F-4 and CSS linting in S-11a; `test:e2e` and `check:all` in S-11b, extended in S-13; `db:release-migration`, `db:pending-report`, `db:check-migrations`, `db:check-risky` in S-14; `test:bats` in S-15); `db:seed` defined (F-20 `seedDevelopmentDatabase`, F-94 `--seed-only`); TP-0.21 and TP-2.24 added. **A-15:** the money rule also bans `Number.parseFloat`, `globalThis.parseFloat`, `window.parseFloat` and unary `+`; TP-0.4 extended. **A-16:** the `migrations` job's diff uses `git -c core.quotePath=false`; TP-0.19 extended. **A-17:** the SHA pin for `uses:` (local `./` exempt) and the `env`-only rule for `run:` apply to every workflow; the existing workflow security test is TP-0.23. **A-18:** F-1 enables `formatjs/no-invalid-icu` (HLD D-37's "valid ICU syntax"); TP-0.22 and TP-11.21 extended. **A-19:** TP-0.20 (b) runs a resolving install (`pnpm install --fix-lockfile`) in a fresh clone, absorbing the test-architect's TP-0.20x; (c) keeps the frozen install. **A-20:** `jsx-a11y` setting `components: { Icon: "svg" }` and `control-has-associated-label` options `labelAttributes: ["label"]`, `ignoreElements: ["input", "select", "textarea"]`. **A-21:** `jsx-a11y` setting `attributes: { for: ["for"] }` for Solid's `for`. TP-11.22 rewritten. A-10, A-12 and A-13 also answer code review G-1 and G-2. Approval stands. |
| 0.13    | 2026-10-07 | Implementation-time amendments A-22 to A-26 from the identity LLD v0.2 §1.1 (PA-7 to PA-11). **A-22:** `presignGet` takes `opts.downloadName` (S3 `ResponseContentDisposition`, fs token `n` and F-145's header, memory URL `n`). **A-23:** `OutboxDao.deleteAll()` and `countAll()`. **A-24:** the fake Google answers sign-in token requests (by `client_id`) with an RS256 `id_token` and serves the JWKS on `www.googleapis.com`; `api` resolves Google to the fake; rehearsal sub-step 7c `google-sign-in`; new F-193 `scanForNeedles` makes step 8's needles concrete. **A-25:** rehearsal sub-step 7b `email-canary` in the harness; the bootstrap owner is `rehearsal-owner.7f3a@example.invalid`, not the canary address. **A-26:** wiring points: F-59 `appRouter` and F-55's defaults, `ApiContainer.moduleRoutes` (F-55 step 4b), `WorkerContainer.onGeneralStarted` with F-78b `runGeneralStartHooks`, `WorkerContainer.erasureHandler` declared, `BaseContainer.sealedColumns` with `rewrapApiSecretsCommand`; the `identity` slot is declared by identity's S-0. Slices S-4, S-6, S-8, S-10, S-13, S-16 extended. Tests: TP-10.1 to TP-10.4, TP-13.4, TP-16.2, TP-16.13 rewritten; TP-4.22, TP-6.14, TP-8.16, TP-16.14, TP-16.15 added. Also A-27 to A-32 from S-0 QA (relayed by the coordinator): **A-27** messages for every layering restriction and for plain `parseFloat`; **A-28** `ci.yml` runs F-6 with `tools/ci`'s own `tsx` (`working-directory: tools/ci`), so exit codes 0/1/64 reach CI; **A-29** F-6's singular `1 changed file` and an actionable failure message; **A-30** `apps/server/tsconfig.json` (S-2) and `apps/web/tsconfig.json` (S-11a), each added to root `typecheck`; **A-31** `test:int` joins the `check` job in S-2; **A-32** `ignoredBuiltDependencies: [esbuild]`. **A-33** (identity PA-12): sub-step 7c sends `X-Budmon-Client: web/<n>` with the candidate's `version.json` build number; F-195 gains an injectable `http`; TP-16.14 rewritten, TP-16.16 added. Tests: TP-0.2, TP-0.4, TP-0.17, TP-0.19, TP-0.20 rewritten; TP-0.24, TP-2.25, TP-2.26 added. Approval stands. |
| 0.14    | 2026-10-07 | Implementation-time amendments A-34 to A-37, raised by the test-architect while writing the S-1 tests. **A-34:** F-310 re-exports the polyfill's `Temporal` namespace (value and types); the native `globalThis.Temporal` is never used. **A-35:** the 100 % branch-coverage criterion for `money/` gets `@vitest/coverage-v8` 5.0.3, a glob-scoped threshold, root script `test:coverage`, and a place in `pnpm check` and CI. **A-36:** `fromWireMoney` with a non-safe-integer amount throws `MoneyRangeError`, checked before the currency code. **A-37:** format vectors aren't tied to a CLDR or ICU version; they hold only CLDR-stable cases, and a mismatch fails on both platforms. Tests: TP-1.7, TP-1.8, TP-1.10, TP-13.9 rewritten; TP-1.14, TP-1.15 added. Approval stands. |
| 0.15    | 2026-10-07 | Implementation-time amendments A-38 to A-42, raised by the software-engineer while implementing S-1 (points the LLD left silent). **A-38:** `canonicalJson` throws `TypeError` for `undefined` as an array element or the top-level value. **A-39:** `resolveLocale` matches by language subtag on both sides, preferring a bare-language supported tag, then list order. **A-40:** `directionOf` has no `ar-XB` special case; the `ar` subtag covers it. **A-41:** `isUuid` accepts versions 1 to 8 with variant `[89ab]`, lower case only; nil and max are rejected. **A-42:** `isValidTimeZone` = accepted by `Intl.DateTimeFormat`, not `Etc/Unknown`, not an offset string. Tests: TP-1.9, TP-1.11, TP-1.12, TP-1.13 extended. Approval stands. |
| 0.16    | 2026-10-07 | Implementation-time amendments A-43 to A-45 from the S-1 code review. **A-43 (G-1):** the server image runs an esbuild bundle (new F-24 `buildServer`, S-2): workspace packages (`@budmon/*`) are bundled from source, the server's `dependencies` stay external; workspace packages keep source `exports`; new F-25 `serverRoot()` locates runtime files in source and bundle alike; JSON reference data is imported, not read; Android has nothing to build; the root `@budmon/shared` dev dependency is recorded in §2.2. **A-44 (N-1):** functions taking a `Rational` normalise it through `rational()`: zero denominator → `RangeError("Zero denominator")`, negative denominator normalised. **A-45 (N-2):** `canonicalJson` throws `TypeError("Circular structure")` on cycles; shared non-cyclic references are fine. Tests: TP-1.2, TP-1.9, TP-2.6 extended; TP-1.16, TP-2.27, TP-2.28 added. Approval stands. |
| 0.17    | 2026-10-07 | Implementation-time amendments A-46 to A-48 from S-1 QA's optional questions. **A-46:** `convertWithRates` validates `minorUnits` (integer 0..4, `RangeError`); `allocate` rejects non-bigint weights (`TypeError`). **A-47:** `Money`'s `minor` and `currency` are non-enumerable; `Money.of` checks the currency format at run time. **A-48:** `canonicalJson` caps nesting at 100 levels (`TypeError("Structure too deep")`). Not changed (reasons in A-48's row and the brief): realm safety, key paths in errors, locale forms and script subtags, `formatMoney`'s trust in `minorUnits`, the `Intl` string overload's `lib` (already ES2024). Tests: TP-1.3, TP-1.5, TP-1.6, TP-1.9 extended. Approval stands. |
| 0.18    | 2026-10-07 | Implementation-time amendments A-49 to A-62, raised by the test-architect while writing the S-2 tests (14 questions). F-19's S-2 shape and S-6 extension; TP-2.15 rewritten around F-17's refusal; F-15 takes a logger, span checks move to S-3; `SchemaStepError` fields; S-2 AC-3 reworded; F-20's `seed` dependency is a closure, TP-2.16 split into unit and integration; TP-2.18 limited to S-2, `/health/ready` moved to TP-4.23; F-24's entry points are the `src/main/*.ts` files present (S-2: api, worker, migrate); `Config` gains `api.googleOAuthRedirectOrigin`, `capture.oauth.redirectOrigin` and `email.smtpTransport`; F-94's testable entry `runDbResetCli`; `DEV_SUPERUSER_URL` in F-10's table (dev tools only); `serverRoot` caches per start directory; the Postgres digest pinned in one test file and copied by S-15 with a check; unprefixed builtins allowed in the bundle. Also: misplaced test rows from v0.13 to v0.16 (TP-0.24, TP-1.14 to TP-1.16, TP-2.25 to TP-2.28, TP-16.16, and A-33's TP-16.14 rewrite) moved from the slice scenario tables into §10.2; no content change. Tests: TP-2.10, TP-2.15, TP-2.16, TP-2.18, TP-2.21, TP-2.22, TP-2.24, TP-2.27, TP-2.28 rewritten; TP-2.29, TP-2.30, TP-3.12, TP-4.23, TP-15.30 added. Approval stands. |
| 0.19    | 2026-10-07 | Implementation-time amendment A-63 (test-architect, S-2): `pnpm dev` creates `.env` from `.env.example` when it's missing and loads it (`ensureDevEnv`, F-22 step 0), so a fresh clone has `DEV_SUPERUSER_URL` and the rest of the development configuration. Tests: TP-2.18 extended; TP-2.31 added. Approval stands. |
| 0.20    | 2026-10-07 | Implementation-time amendments A-64 to A-72: decisions on the engineer's S-2 choices. **A-64:** `db:reset`/`db:seed` package scripts are plain `tsx src/main/dbReset.ts`; `dbReset.ts` loads `<repo>/.env` itself (A-58's `--env-file-if-exists` dropped). **A-65:** every ignored build script (`esbuild`, `cpu-features`, `protobufjs`, `ssh2`) is listed in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` only; no `pnpm` field in the root `package.json`. **A-66:** `@budmon/config` exports `./tsconfig/*.json`. **A-67:** `apps/server/tsconfig.json` includes `scripts/**/*.ts` and sets `resolveJsonModule`. **A-68:** push mode is loaded through a variable dynamic import; the bundle has no `drizzle-kit`. **A-69:** `iso4217.json`'s sources (ISO 4217 lists for codes and minor units, CLDR English names). **A-70:** Mailpit pinned by the same digest in both Compose files, with tests. **A-71:** `Config.migrate.previousPassword`. **A-72:** `seedAll` builds no container while there are no seeders. Tests: TP-0.20, TP-2.1, TP-2.14, TP-2.27, TP-2.29 extended; TP-2.32, TP-15.31 added. Approval stands. |
| 0.21    | 2026-10-07 | Implementation-time amendments A-73 to A-78 from the S-2 code review. **A-73 (B-3):** every development server process runs with the repository root as its working directory (`pnpm dev`'s children, `dbReset.ts`), so `.env`'s relative paths resolve; in prod every `*_FILE` must be absolute. **A-74 (B-1):** F-20's guard checks the effective host after `pg-connection-string` parsing and refuses `host`/`hostaddr` query parameters and multi-host or socket URLs. **A-75 (N-1):** `cluster-bootstrap.sql` takes the password from the environment (`\getenv`) and lets psql quote it; `\connect :"dbname"`; fixed in S-2. **A-76 (N-3):** the `PUBLIC_ORIGIN` localhost rule and the optional `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` extend to `APP_ENV=test`. **A-77 (N-5):** F-15 refuses existing roles with unexpected attributes (`role_attributes_unexpected`). **A-78:** `iso4217.json` names stay CLDR verbatim. Tests: TP-2.10, TP-2.16, TP-2.18 extended; TP-2.33, TP-2.34, TP-2.35 added. Approval stands. |
| 0.22    | 2026-10-07 | Implementation-time amendment A-79 (S-2 round-2 review G-1): F-20's `TESTCONTAINERS=1` environment override is removed; an explicit input `allowNonLocalHost?: boolean` (default `false`), set only by TP-2.16 (b), relaxes the host allowlist. No environment variable can widen the guard. A-74's wording updated. Tests: TP-2.16, TP-2.24, TP-2.29 extended. Approval stands. |
| 0.23    | 2026-10-07 | Implementation-time amendments A-80 to A-88 from S-2 QA (three defects and design gaps). **A-80:** a missing `drizzle/meta/_journal.json` means zero migrations (F-18, F-57); AC-2 reworded. **A-81:** new F-26 `describeFailure` gives every entry point's failure log or line a sanitised class, code and non-secret reason. **A-82:** `SMTP_URL` needs a host, a port in 1..65535, and no path, query or fragment. **A-83:** `.env` loading per entry point; `db:migrate` gets a development wrapper (`devMigrate.ts`) and F-22 writes `migrator_password`. **A-84:** `ResetRefusedError` names its reason (a fixed code and phrase, never the URL). **A-85:** the README's S-2 sections, and which slices extend them. **A-86:** `pnpm dev` waits for Postgres over TCP from the host and prints a readable failure. **A-87:** CI's Node version comes from `.nvmrc` (24) in every job, with a test. **A-88:** one development stack per Docker daemon; no project or port overrides. Tests: TP-2.13, TP-2.16, TP-2.18, TP-2.22, TP-2.24 extended; TP-0.25, TP-2.36 to TP-2.40 added. Approval stands. |
| 0.24    | 2026-10-07 | Implementation-time amendments A-89 to A-91 (test-architect, against v0.23). **A-89:** F-26 gains `runCommand(command, fn, stderr)`, the testable wrapper behind `dev.ts`, `devMigrate.ts` and `dbReset.ts`'s unexpected failures. **A-90:** `devMigrateEnv` returns a new object and never changes its argument. **A-91:** a reset or seed refusal prints the A-84 message only (exit 2); A-81's line is for unexpected failures (exit 1). Tests: TP-2.29, TP-2.38, TP-2.39 extended. Approval stands. |
| 0.25    | 2026-10-08 | Implementation-time amendment A-92 (CI blocker on PR #1): F-6 ignores exactly `apps/server/drizzle/.gitkeep`, so the placeholder that keeps the empty migrations folder in git isn't reported as a migration file. AC-2 clarified. Tests: TP-0.5, TP-0.17 extended. Approval stands. |
| 0.26    | 2026-10-08 | Implementation-time amendments A-93, A-94 (S-2 round-4 review notes). **A-93:** an `APP_ENV` outside `AppEnv` refuses with the fixed phrase `APP_ENV is not a known environment` and never echoes the value. **A-94:** `db:migrate`'s environment order restated: `devMigrateEnv` applies to the shell environment only, and its result is laid over `.env`; A-83's wording corrected. Tests: TP-2.16 extended; TP-2.41 added. Approval stands. |
| 0.27    | 2026-10-08 | Implementation-time amendments A-95 to A-99 (S-2 QA minor findings; built with S-3). **A-95:** `runDbResetCli` ignores a bare `--`; the README drops the "if your shell needs it" advice. **A-96:** multi-host and empty-host `?host=` URLs refuse as `unparseable_url` (accepted). **A-97:** `waitForPostgres` fails at once on an authentication error and otherwise ends with `PostgresNotReadyError` (reason `postgres_not_ready`). **A-98:** `db:seed` with no seeders stays a no-op that needs no database. **A-99:** `SMTP_URL` with a trailing `?` or `#` is refused. Tests: TP-2.16, TP-2.22, TP-2.29, TP-2.39, TP-2.40 extended. Approval stands. |
| 0.28    | 2026-10-08 | Implementation-time amendments A-100 to A-103 (test-architect, S-3 tests `38e3cc0`). **A-100:** F-50 `BudmonError` moves from S-4 to S-3. **A-101:** F-35 replaces every exception `value` by its `type` unless it is an API error key. **A-102:** §10.1 projects include `apps/server/test/privacy/**` (`server-int`) and `packages/test-support/test/**` (`tools`); `@budmon/test-support` and the OpenTelemetry SDK test dependencies recorded. **A-103:** kept breadcrumbs keep `category`. Tests: TP-3.5 extended. Approval stands. |
| 0.29    | 2026-10-08 | Implementation-time amendments A-104 to A-109: the engineer's S-3 deviations (`f3dfb39`). **A-104:** Sentry 11 option names (`dataCollection` all off, `enableOpenTelemetrySetup: false`). **A-105:** F-38 takes a structural `RequestLogHost`; its test is S-4's TP-4.17. **A-106:** F-36 reads nothing from the environment; without an endpoint or injected reader there is no MeterProvider and instruments are no-ops. **A-107:** pg-boss tracing is S-6's. **A-108:** §2.4 OpenTelemetry and `@fastify/otel` pins; SDK packages are runtime dependencies. **A-109:** `createLogger` takes `stream: "stdout" | "stderr"`; `migrate`, `cli` and `db:*` log to stderr, so stdout carries only command output. Tests: TP-2.37 extended. Approval stands. |
| 0.30    | 2026-10-08 | Implementation-time amendments A-110 to A-117 from the S-3 code review (privacy breaches). **A-110 (G-1):** stack frames only after the `String(err)` header, rebuilt from parsed, pattern-checked parts; new `buildErrorEvent`; Sentry-native events rebuilt from `hint.originalException`, otherwise their frames dropped. **A-111 (G-2):** `http_route` labels use the route rule; unmatched requests are `/unmatched`. **A-112 (G-3):** `ErrorContext` values validated with F-30's rules in F-34 and again in F-35; `route` query stripped. **A-113:** the logger's fixed keys win. **A-114:** span links lose their attributes. **A-115:** start-up `release` falls back to `dev`. **A-116:** `token`-kind fields carry code constants only. **A-117:** `scanForCanaries` finds base64 at any byte alignment. **A-118:** Sentry's process integrations print nothing; F-90/F-91's own handlers log through F-31 and exit 1. Tests: TP-3.5, TP-3.6, TP-16.1 extended; TP-3.13 to TP-3.17 added. Approval stands. |
| 0.31    | 2026-10-08 | Implementation-time amendment A-119 (S-3, after `af1d49d`): A-110's frame `function` rule allows a space only after `async ` or `new `; filename reduction is idempotent. TP-3.5 and TP-3.13 unchanged in intent (the fixture's spaced name is dropped). Approval stands. |
| 0.32    | 2026-10-08 | Implementation-time amendments A-120, A-121 (test-architect, S-3 leak tests `2228e71`). **A-120:** new F-39 `startupState` and `installFatalHandlers` (`platform/observability/fatal.ts`) with injectable logger destination, exit and event target; how TP-3.16 and TP-3.17 drive them. **A-121:** A-112 tightened: `userId` a UUID, `requestId` 32 lower-case hex, `jobName` F-70's job-name format; `route` and `errorKey` stay shape-checked code constants. Tests: TP-3.6, TP-3.14, TP-3.16, TP-3.17 rewritten. Approval stands. |
| 0.33    | 2026-10-08 | Implementation-time amendment A-122: F-34 sends the request id as a `request_id` tag, allowed by F-35 under A-121's rule. TP-3.6 wording made exact. Approval stands. |
| 0.34    | 2026-10-08 | Implementation-time amendments A-123 to A-129 (test-architect, S-4 tests `67e5515`). **A-123:** F-53 exports `requireAuth`, `requireOwner` and `procedureBases(contract)`. **A-124:** F-61 and F-62 move to S-4 (with TP-5.1 to TP-5.4); F-65's coarse limit stays S-5. **A-125:** `registerHealthRoutes` deps defined; `createApiServer` takes `opts.journal`, so TP-4.13 (c) runs over HTTP. **A-126:** F-160 gets injectable catalogues (`createMessageRenderer`); no test message in `en.json`. **A-127:** F-349's `prefix` defined. **A-128:** TP-4.7's version is `API_VERSION`. **A-129:** Kotlin spike toolchain pins. Tests: TP-4.7, TP-4.13, TP-4.20, TP-5.1 to TP-5.4 changed. Approval stands. |
| 0.35    | 2026-10-08 | Implementation-time amendment A-130 (test-architect, S-4): `budmon_app` gets `USAGE` on schema `drizzle` and `SELECT` on `drizzle.__drizzle_migrations` (F-16 step 5) for F-57's readiness check; §3.4's leftover "English ISO names" line aligned with A-69. Tests: TP-2.11, TP-4.13 extended. Approval stands. |
| 0.36    | 2026-10-08 | Implementation-time amendments A-131 to A-140 from S-3 QA (built with S-4). **A-131:** `SENTRY_DSN` format validated (F-10, and again in `initSentry`); Sentry's console silenced. **A-132:** F-33/F-26/F-34 never throw on throwing getters. **A-133:** F-30/F-31 drop and count a field whose getter throws. **A-134:** F-35 reads Sentry 11's array `breadcrumbs`; none are generated on the server. **A-135:** F-40 masks literals in `db.query.text`; span names shape-checked. **A-136:** `route`/`http_route` reject UUID-like and long-digit segments. **A-137:** Sentry tags `error_code` and `http_status`. **A-138:** OTLP endpoint URL building, `OTLP_HEADERS_FILE`, duplicate metric labels throw. **A-139:** `droppedKeys` in development and test logs. **A-140:** config-failure output unchanged. Tests: TP-3.4, TP-3.5, TP-3.6, TP-3.7, TP-3.8, TP-3.9, TP-3.11, TP-3.2 extended; TP-2.42, TP-3.18 added. Approval stands. |
| 0.37    | 2026-10-08 | Implementation-time amendments A-141 to A-145 (S-4 and A-131 to A-139 implemented). **A-141:** an `http://<key>@localhost|127.0.0.1:<port>/<id>` DSN is accepted in development and test only (F-10 and `initSentry`), for the local fake Sentry. **A-142:** engineer deviations recorded: F-36 `cfg.headers`, SQL comments masked, OTLP credential check and problem phrases, `sanitizeFieldsWithKeys`. **A-143:** contract implementation notes (R1/R3 scope, `@orpc/server` dependency, `listProcedures` export, oasdiff pin, schema registry entries, helmet `useDefaults: false`). **A-144:** Fastify's `disableRequestLogging` removed (FSTDEP023). **A-145:** body-error requests log route `/unmatched`. Tests: TP-2.42, TP-3.7, TP-3.18 extended. Approval stands. |
| 0.38    | 2026-10-08 | Implementation-time amendment A-146: F-18 always creates schema `drizzle` and `__drizzle_migrations` in migrate mode, even with no journal or an empty one; F-57's behaviour when the table is absent restated. Tests: TP-2.11, TP-2.13, TP-4.13 extended. Approval stands. |
| 0.39    | 2026-10-08 | Implementation-time amendments A-147 to A-154 from the S-4 code review. **A-147 (G-1):** telemetry starts in a `--import` preload (new F-89 `main/instrument.ts`) that registers OpenTelemetry's ESM loader hook before any application module loads; every api and worker start runs `node --import ./dist/main/instrument.js dist/main/<entry>.js` (dev: `tsx --import`). **A-148 (G-2):** oRPC's smart-coercion plugin on the OpenAPI handler; schemas stay typed. **A-149 (G-3):** contract-defined (`defined: true`) errors pass through F-52 with their status and data. **A-150 (B-4):** a journal file without an `entries` array is `JournalInvalidError` (exit 5). **A-151:** helmet's other defaults accepted and listed. **A-152:** F-62 parses JSON with `secure-json-parse` (`__proto__`/`constructor` removed). **A-153:** `UuidSchema` uses the `isUuid` rule. **A-154:** authentication runs only for `/api/v1/*`. Tests: TP-2.13, TP-4.9, TP-4.13, TP-5.1, TP-5.2 extended; TP-4.24 to TP-4.27, TP-6.15 added. Approval stands. |
| 0.40    | 2026-10-09 | Implementation-time amendments A-155 to A-161: the engineer's choices implementing A-147 to A-154 (`3ef90f3`). `telemetryHandle.ts`; the preload creates the drop counter; worker telemetry service name; worker shuts telemetry down until S-6; `module.register` lint suppression; `JournalInvalidError` covers malformed entries and missing SQL files; F-90's `api_started` text corrected. Tests: TP-2.13 extended. Approval stands. |
| 0.41    | 2026-10-09 | Implementation-time amendment A-162: the journal is validated before any database work, in `runMigrate` (after the configuration check, before connecting) and in F-18 (before A-146's two statements). Text only. Approval stands. |
| 0.42    | 2026-10-09 | Implementation-time amendments A-163, A-164 (S-4, `487b6b7`). **A-163:** `@fastify/otel` with `registerOnInitialization: true`; its spans are INTERNAL under the http SERVER span; TP-4.24 asserts accordingly. **A-164:** span-name rule allows `*`; `@fastify/otel` hook spans are named by their hook only, with no drop counted. Tests: TP-3.7, TP-4.24 changed. Approval stands. |
| 0.43    | 2026-10-09 | Implementation-time amendments A-165 to A-169 (S-4 re-review). **A-165 (G-1):** coercion only for GET, HEAD and DELETE; bodies are never coerced; R4 adds string-only path parameters on body-carrying operations. **A-166 (G-2):** F-52's defined-error rule moves after rules 2 and 3, uses the declared message, drops undeclared data, and excludes `INTERNAL`/`SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE`. **A-167 (G-3):** pins for `@orpc/json-schema` and `@opentelemetry/instrumentation`. **A-168 (N-1):** auth and the version header key on `request.routeOptions.url`. **A-169 (N-2):** `UuidSchema` registered through `JSON_SCHEMA_REGISTRY`; a drift test keeps contract's `UUID_PATTERN` equal to `isUuid`'s. Tests: TP-4.5, TP-4.9, TP-4.13, TP-4.25, TP-4.26 extended; TP-4.28 added. Approval stands. |
| 0.44    | 2026-10-09 | Implementation-time amendments A-170 to A-172 (S-4, `f9c06cc`). **A-170:** `mapError`'s optional `declared` error map and the interceptor's `errorMap`. **A-171:** optional `RequestContext.method`; coercion only when it's `GET`, `HEAD` or `DELETE`. **A-172:** a defined `SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE` keeps 503 with `{ outcome }` and is reported. Tests: TP-4.9, TP-4.25 extended. Approval stands. |
| 0.45    | 2026-10-09 | Implementation-time amendments A-173, A-174 (test-architect, `f369019`). **A-173:** `DELETE` operations take input from path parameters only (no query, no body), enforced by R4; coercion applies to `GET` and `HEAD` only; every non-GET path parameter is a string schema. **A-174:** TP-4.9's A-170 example uses module key `PAYEE_EXISTS`. Tests: TP-4.5, TP-4.9, TP-4.25 changed. Approval stands. |
| 0.46    | 2026-10-09 | Implementation-time amendment A-175 (`d89a125`): `HEAD` isn't supported on `/api/v1`; it answers 404 like any unsupported method; coercion applies to `GET` only; path parameters of every non-GET operation are string schemas. Tests: TP-4.25 changed. Approval stands. |
| 0.47    | 2026-10-09 | Implementation-time amendments A-176 to A-180 from S-4 QA. **A-176 (D-1):** `url.path` leaves the span allowlist; the oRPC route template is recorded as `budmon.route`. **A-177 (D-2):** `server.address`/`server.port` dropped from SERVER spans and from server metrics; kept for CLIENT spans. **A-178 (D-3):** Fastify `frameworkErrors` answer pre-routing errors with the platform envelope; `clientErrorHandler` writes fixed bodiless responses for 400/408/431. **A-179 (O-1):** migrate mode with an empty journal stops after step 2; a listed table missing later is `SchemaStepError("table_missing")`. **A-180 (O-2):** overall shutdown budgets (api 8 s, workers 35 s) and Compose `stop_grace_period` (api 15 s, workers 45 s). Tests: TP-2.15, TP-3.7, TP-3.11, TP-4.24 extended; TP-4.29, TP-4.30 added. Approval stands. |
| 0.48    | 2026-10-09 | Implementation-time amendments A-181 to A-185 (S-4, `f5c9973`). **A-181:** no `http.server.*` View (it would double-count); a test asserts server metrics carry no `server.address`/`server.port`. **A-182:** `applySecurityHeaders` is a fixed table in `security/headers.ts`, with a drift test against helmet. **A-183:** framework-error replies also record F-38's two metrics. **A-184:** client-error mapping and `reason` values confirmed. **A-185:** empty-journal detection confirmed. Tests: TP-3.11, TP-4.30, TP-5.1 extended. Approval stands. |
| 0.49    | 2026-10-09 | Implementation-time amendment A-186 (S-4 review N-1, optional; built in S-5): the oRPC route interceptor also sets the RPC metadata route, so the http SERVER span and `http.route` carry the procedure template. Tests: TP-4.24 extended (in S-5). Approval stands. |
| 0.50    | 2026-10-09 | Implementation-time amendments A-187 to A-193 (test-architect, S-5 tests `cff8a8a`). TP-4.24 base row loosened for A-186; IP never logged (TP-5.10 echoes in the response); TP-5.9 uses a Buffer key; TP-5.5's rolled-back hit asserts a refusal; user-facing rate-limit wording is the clients' (S-11b, S-13); no coarse-limit knob for tests; F-80's purge belongs to S-6. Tests: TP-4.24, TP-5.5, TP-5.9, TP-5.10, TP-6.12 changed. Approval stands. |
| 0.51    | 2026-10-09 | Implementation-time amendments A-194 to A-199: the engineer's S-5 choices (`56735d5`), confirmed. Coarse 429 via `CoarseRateLimitError`; only `Retry-After`; `windowSeconds` check; Argon2id as the binding default; `createApiContainer` needs `config.api` or a `rateLimiter`; A-186 only with HTTP RPC metadata. §2.4 already pins `@node-rs/argon2` 2.2.1 and `@fastify/rate-limit` 11.2.0. No test changes. Approval stands. |
| 0.52    | 2026-10-09 | Implementation-time amendment A-200 (S-5 review N-3): `randomToken`'s 16..64-byte bounds confirmed and stated in its signature comment; TP-5.9 adds the boundaries. Approval stands. |
| 0.53    | 2026-10-09 | Implementation-time amendments A-201 to A-210 (test-architect, S-6 tests `e554a98`). `runWorker(env, overrides)` and a bundle fixture; `buildJobRegistry()`; gap-check enqueue only when registered; A-179 narrowed to fresh databases, queue steps always run; logger parameters for `syncQueues` and F-79 (`PlatformMetrics`); `attempt` = `retryCount + 1`; healthcheck reads the file content and `PORT`; F-90 starts the send-only pg-boss; F-80's handler exports and one log line per run. Tests: TP-2.15, TP-6.6, TP-6.7, TP-6.9, TP-6.10, TP-6.12, TP-6.13, TP-6.15 changed. Approval stands. |

## Amendments

| ID | Question (raised by) | Resolution | Sections changed | HLD change | Kind |
| -- | -------------------- | ---------- | ---------------- | ---------- | ---- |
| A-1 | `Principal` needs the session id for sign-out, "this device", step-up and session-scoped checks (identity HLD v0.5 §5.6 PA-1). | `Principal` gains `readonly sessionId: string`; the test helper `testPrincipal()` builds every fixture principal; TP-4.16 asserts it passes through unchanged. Lands in **S-4**. | §4.0 shared types (`Principal`), §10.1 helpers, S-4, TP-4.16 | none | planner decision |
| A-2 | Email in stage 0 (identity PA-2). | The laptop's `budmon-main` gains `mailpit` (`--quiet`, logging driver `none`, SMTP on `data`, inbox on `127.0.0.1:8025` only, network `mail-ui`); worker-general config gains `SMTP_URL`, `SMTP_PASSWORD_FILE`, `EMAIL_FROM` and `PUBLIC_ORIGIN` (same `site.env` value as api's); `install` prompts for `SMTP_URL` and `EMAIL_FROM` with Mailpit defaults; F-191 writes an empty `SMTP_PASSWORD`; the rehearsal checks Mailpit is quiet (step 8b) and carries the email canary path, which `identity`'s build adds to the canary flows. Config lands in **S-2**, the stack and prompts in **S-15**, the rehearsal in **S-16**. | §4.2 (F-10 table, `Config`), F-175 (services, networks, `site.env`), F-191, F-195 steps 4, 7, 8b, §7.8, §2.4, S-2, S-15, S-16, TP-2.22, TP-15.23, TP-15.27, TP-16.13 | HLD D-29 v1.3: stage-0 container list gains `mailpit` | **needs user confirmation** |
| A-3 | New configuration and secrets for Google sign-in and recovery codes (identity PA-3). | API config `GOOGLE_SIGNIN_CLIENT_ID` (required in prod), `GOOGLE_SIGNIN_ANDROID_CLIENT_IDS`, `GOOGLE_SIGNIN_CALLBACK_ORIGIN`, `GOOGLE_SIGNIN_APP_ORIGINS`; secrets `GOOGLE_SIGNIN_CLIENT_SECRET_FILE` (D-20: rotated by replacement) and `RECOVERY_CODE_HMAC_KEYS_FILE` (D-20: data-bound, carried over at the stage-1 gate, rotated by adding a key); F-191 generates the key ring and a placeholder for the client secret; `install` prompts for the four non-secret values; the API reaches Google's token and JWKS endpoints over `egress`; Android build property `budmon.googleServerClientId` (F-265). Config lands in **S-2**, secrets and prompts in **S-15**, F-265 in **S-13**. | §4.2, F-175, F-191, F-265, §7.8, runbook, S-2, S-13, S-15, TP-2.23, TP-13.17, TP-15.23, TP-15.27 | none (classified under D-20's existing rules) | planner decision |
| A-4 | Google's callback carries `code` and `state` in its query string, against D-24 rule 4 (identity PA-4). | `GET /api/v1/auth/google/callback?code&state` is the one stated exception, listed in §5.3 with its mitigations; contract rule R4 is unchanged; TP-15.13 proves Caddy logs the bare path; the runbook's stage-0 checklist confirms Caddy and Tailscale Serve keep no query strings. Lands in **S-15** (Caddy test, runbook); the route itself is `identity`'s. | §5.3, runbook, S-15, TP-15.13 | HLD D-24 rule 4 v1.3: the exception and its mitigations | **needs user confirmation** |
| A-5 | Egress for stage 1's firewall work (identity PA-5). | Recorded in §7.8: API → `oauth2.googleapis.com:443`, `www.googleapis.com:443`; worker-general → the email provider's SMTP host on 587 or 465; for the stage-1 LLD. No stage-0 change beyond A-3's note that `api` uses `egress` for Google. No slice. | §7.8, F-175 networks note | none | planner decision |
| A-6 | The owner bootstrap needs a platform entry point that keeps the token out of Docker logs (identity PA-6). | F-93 lists `identity:bootstrap-owner --email <address> [--replace]` with config kind `api` (as `budmon_app`, the API's `PUBLIC_ORIGIN`), stdout only, exits 0/1/64; its handler is identity's; unknown commands now print `Unknown command: <name>`. `budmon-local bootstrap-owner` runs it with `docker compose exec -T` in the running `api` container (exit 25 if not running; never `compose run`). The rehearsal runs it in step 7 and scans for its token (skipped until identity exists). Wrapper lands in **S-15**, rehearsal in **S-16**; the F-93 row is filled by `identity`'s build. | F-93, F-178, F-195 step 7, runbook, S-15, S-16, TP-15.29, TP-16.13 | none | planner decision |
| A-7 | F-6's file and CLI line disagree (`tools/ci/checkMigrationFiles.ts` vs `src/checkMigrationFiles.ts`), and how the CLI's inputs reach it from `ci.yml` isn't defined (test-architect, S-0). | One location: `tools/ci/checkMigrationFiles.ts`. `@budmon/tools-ci` keeps its sources at the package root (no `src/`), so F-185's CLI line becomes `tsx buildNumber.ts <tag>` too. F-6 gains `parseCheckMigrationFilesArgs`, `parseChangedFiles` and `runCheckMigrationFilesCli` (exit 0 / 1 / 64) and an entry guard; arguments `--branch <head ref>`, `--changed-files <file>`, `--hotfix-merge-back`. `ci.yml`'s `migrations` job (created in **S-0**, extended in S-14) runs on `pull_request` (types `opened`, `synchronize`, `reopened`, `labeled`, `unlabeled`), checks out with `fetch-depth: 0`, writes `git diff --no-renames --name-only "origin/${BASE_REF}...HEAD"` to `$RUNNER_TEMP/changed-files.txt`, and passes `github.head_ref` and the `hotfix-merge-back`/`infra-merge-back` labels through `env`, never by `${{ }}` interpolation into the script. Lands in **S-0**. | §2.2 (`tools/ci/`, `ci.yml`), F-6, F-185, S-0, §10.1 CI jobs, TP-0.17, TP-0.19 | none | planner decision |
| A-8 | §10.1 names `vitest.workspace.ts`; Vitest 4 removed workspace files and Vitest 5.0.3 throws on them (test-architect, S-0). | The root `vitest.config.ts` declares the same projects through `test.projects` (`shared`, `contract`, `server-unit`, `server-int`, `tools` in S-0; `web-unit` added in S-11a; `server-int`'s `globalSetup` added in S-2) with `test.passWithNoTests: true`, because several projects have no tests until their slice. No `vitest.workspace.ts` or `vitest.workspace.*` file exists. Pins unchanged: `vitest` 5.0.3 and TypeScript 5.9.3 (§2.4). Lands in **S-0**. | §10.1 Runner, §2.2 (root configs), S-0 | none | planner decision |
| A-9 | `.gitattributes` is in §2.2 but sits in S-15's function list, so S-0 (which creates the files every later commit depends on) doesn't own it (test-architect, S-0). | Moves to **S-0** with the exact content in §2.2 (`* text=auto eol=lf`; LF for `*.sh`, `*.bash`, `*.bats`, `gradlew`, `infra/local/budmon-local`; CRLF for `*.bat`, `*.cmd`, `*.ps1`; `binary` for `*.png`, `*.jpg`, `*.jar`, `*.keystore`, `*.dump`). The index holds no CRLF text file. Removed from S-15. | §2.2 `.gitattributes`, S-0, S-15, TP-0.18 | none (implements HLD D-29's Windows rules) | planner decision |
| A-10 | F-3's "any module whose name matches `/icons?/`" also flags the app's own `./ui/icons/registry.js` imports and anything under `ui/icons/`. Limit it to package specifiers, or explicitly allow relative imports of the registry? (software-engineer, S-0; code review G-2 adds `./iconButton`, the registry's alias path, and whether `export … from` and `import()` count) | Only **non-relative** specifiers are checked against icon packages. A specifier is relative when it starts with `./`, `../` or `/`; relative imports are never reported as icon packages, so importing the registry or `Icon.tsx` from anywhere is allowed. For a non-relative specifier, a leading URL scheme (`virtual:`, `node:`, …) is stripped and the **package name** is taken (`@scope/name`, or the first path segment); it's reported when the package name is `lucide-solid` or `@tabler/icons-solidjs` or matches `/icon/i` (so `~icons/…` and `virtual:icons/…` are caught; subpaths such as `@budmon/shared/icons` aren't). Checked nodes: `ImportDeclaration` (including `import type`), `ExportNamedDeclaration`/`ExportAllDeclaration` with a `source`, and `ImportExpression` whose source is a string literal or an expression-free template literal. `export … from` and literal `import()` count as imports. The web app defines **no path aliases** (F-5 `web` has no `paths`, and §8.1's Vite config has no `resolve.alias`), so the registry is only ever imported relatively and needs no alias allowance; adding an alias later needs an F-3 amendment. Exempt file: `apps/web/src/ui/icons/registry.ts`. Separately, any import (relative or not) of a `.svg` file (`/\.svg(\?.*)?$/`) outside `apps/web/src/ui/icons/**` is reported, as is `<svg>` outside `apps/web/src/ui/icons/**` (unchanged). The rule file lands with S-0's rule files; its tests are S-11a's. | F-3, TP-11.19 | none | planner decision |
| A-11 | The service layering rule targets `*Service.ts` with no `files` scope; the engineer used `**/*Service.ts` (software-engineer, S-0). | `files: ["apps/server/src/*/*Service.ts", "apps/server/src/platform/*/*Service.ts"]`: module services (HLD D-34 layout `src/<module>/<module>Service.ts`) and platform services (`platform/<area>/<area>Service.ts`, e.g. F-132's `platform/fx/fxService.ts`). Files elsewhere named `*Service.ts` (web, tools, tests, deeper server folders) aren't covered by this rule. The `platform/http/**` repo ban still applies on top for files in both scopes. Lands in **S-0**. | F-1 rule 1, S-0, TP-0.2 | none | planner decision |
| A-12 | `formatjs/enforce-id` needs an `idInterpolationPattern`; the engineer used the default `[sha512:contenthash:base64:6]` (software-engineer, S-0). | Not confirmed. The web catalog (§8.1) uses **explicit dotted IDs** (`error.generic.read`, `validation.too_small`), which a hash pattern reports as wrong (and its autofix would rewrite to hashes); and in `eslint-plugin-formatjs` 5.4.2 the rule's hash path calls `context.getFilename()`, which ESLint 10 removed, so a descriptor crashes the lint run instead of reporting (code review G-1). Even on 8.1.1 (A-13), `enforce-id` can only accept semantic IDs through a case-insensitive `idWhitelist`, reports an ID-less descriptor as a hash mismatch, and autofixes to a hash. **Message-ID scheme: explicit, semantic, dotted IDs** written by hand in every descriptor; no generated IDs anywhere. `formatjs/enforce-id` is therefore **not enabled**. It's replaced by a Budmon rule **F-3b `budmon/message-id`** (explicit, literal ID matching `^[a-z][A-Za-z0-9_]*(\.[a-z][A-Za-z0-9_]*)+$`), which keeps HLD D-37's "every message has an ID". F-1 also sets `settings.formatjs.additionalFunctionNames: ["t"]` so `formatjs/enforce-default-message` sees inline `t({…})` descriptors, and F-9's extraction passes `--additional-function-names t` and no `--id-interpolation-pattern`, so lint and extraction find the same descriptors and use the same explicit IDs. The rule file and its F-1 registration land in **S-0** (with F-2, F-3); tests in **S-11a**. | F-1 rule 4, new F-3b, F-9, §2.2 (`packages/config`), S-0, S-11a, TP-11.30 | none (D-37's lint requirement is kept; the ID check is a Budmon rule instead of a `formatjs` one) | planner decision |
| A-13 | `eslint-plugin-formatjs` 5.4.2 and `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` 6.10.2 declare ESLint 9 as their peer, while §2.4 pins ESLint 10 (software-engineer, S-0). Code review G-1: formatjs 5.4.2's `enforce-id` crashes the whole lint run under ESLint 10.12.0 (`context.getFilename is not a function`); formatjs 8.x declares `eslint: 9 \|\| 10`. | **Keep ESLint 10.12.0.** **`eslint-plugin-formatjs` is pinned to 8.1.1** (latest, peer `9 \|\| 10`, ESM default export; it reads `context.filename`, and its `enforce-default-message`, `no-literal-string-in-jsx` and `settings.formatjs.additionalFunctionNames` are unchanged), so it needs no peer exception. **`eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` stays at 6.10.2**, pinned exactly: it has no release with an ESLint 10 peer, and code review verified all eight configured rules on ESLint 10.12.0 (the installed sources use none of the context methods ESLint 10 removed). Its mismatch is declared, not ignored: `pnpm-workspace.yaml` gets `peerDependencyRules.allowedVersions` with exactly one entry, `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y>eslint: "10"` (no `ignoreMissing`, nothing else), so `pnpm install` is warning-free and any other peer problem still shows. Verified in **S-0** by TP-0.20 (pins and install output) and TP-0.22 (a smoke lint of a web fixture: every configured web rule reports and the run doesn't crash), and again in **S-11a** by TP-11.21/TP-11.22. When jsx-a11y publishes an ESLint 10 peer, upgrading and deleting the entry is a routine dependency change. Enabling any further rule from either plugin needs the same smoke coverage. | §2.2 (`pnpm-workspace.yaml`), §2.4 Lint, S-0, S-11a, TP-0.20, TP-0.22, TP-11.21, TP-11.22 | none | planner decision |
| A-14 | Root scripts `dev`, `check:all`, `db:*`, `contract:openapi`, and `stylelint.config.js` with F-4, weren't added in S-0 because S-0's function list doesn't include them; make sure each has an owning slice (software-engineer, S-0). | New **§2.2.2** lists every root script with its exact command and owning slice; S-0 adds only its own rows, each later slice adds its rows. `dev`, `db:reset`, `db:seed`, `db:migrate` → **S-2**; `contract:openapi` → **S-4**; `stylelint.config.js`, F-4, the `@budmon/config` `./stylelint` export and `lint:css` → **S-11a**; `test:e2e` and `check:all` (`check` + `test:e2e`) → **S-11b**, `check:all` extended with Android's `./gradlew check` in **S-13**; `db:release-migration`, `db:pending-report`, `db:check-migrations`, `db:check-risky` → **S-14**; `test:bats` → **S-15**. `db:migrate`, missing from §2.2's list though HLD D-34 names it, is added. `db:seed` had no behaviour: it runs the seeders (F-23) against the existing local development database without dropping it, behind F-20's guard (new `seedDevelopmentDatabase` in F-20; F-94 `--seed-only`). | §2.2, new §2.2.2, F-4, F-20, F-94, §6 (`ResetRefusedError`), S-0, S-2, S-4, S-11a, S-11b, S-13, S-14, S-15, §10.1 Scripts, TP-0.21, TP-2.24 | none (implements HLD D-34's script list) | planner decision |
| A-15 | Code review (optional): F-1's money rule misses `Number.parseFloat`, `globalThis.parseFloat` and unary `+`. | Added to F-1 rule 3, same scope and same described-disable escape: `no-restricted-properties` for `Number.parseFloat`, `globalThis.parseFloat` and `window.parseFloat` ("parseFloat is forbidden; use the money helpers"); `no-restricted-syntax` gains `UnaryExpression[operator='+']` ("Unary + conversion is forbidden; use the money helpers or Number.parseInt with a reason"). `Number.parseInt` stays allowed. Lands in **S-0**. | F-1 rule 3, TP-0.4 | none | planner decision |
| A-16 | Code review (optional): `git diff` quotes non-ASCII paths (`core.quotePath`), so a quoted `"apps/server/drizzle/…"` line slips past F-6's prefix check. | The `migrations` job's diff step runs `git -c core.quotePath=false diff --no-renames --name-only "origin/${BASE_REF}...HEAD"`, so every path is written verbatim. F-6 itself is unchanged. Lands in **S-0**. | F-6 wiring, TP-0.19 | none | planner decision |
| A-17 | The LLD states the SHA pin for `uses:` and the `env`-only rule for `run:` only for F-6's `migrations` job (A-7); the test-architect's workflow security test applies them to every workflow (coordinator, from code review B-4, S-0). | Both are rules for **every workflow under `.github/workflows/`**: every job- or step-level `uses:` is pinned to a 40-hex commit SHA, except local `./` references (actions and reusable workflows in this repository); no `run:` contains a `${{` expression, values reaching scripts only through `env:`. Recorded in §2.2 (workflow rules row). The existing test `tools/ci/test/workflowSecurity.test.ts` (labelled "TP-0.21x" by the test-architect) is this LLD's **TP-0.23**; its IDs should be renamed to TP-0.23 (TP-0.21 is now the root-scripts test, A-14). Lands in **S-0**. | §2.2 (workflows), S-0, TP-0.23 | none | planner decision |
| A-18 | HLD D-37 requires web lint to check "valid ICU syntax", and F-1 has no rule for it (planner, found while answering A-12; confirmed by the coordinator). | F-1 rule 4 enables **`formatjs/no-invalid-icu`** (in `eslint-plugin-formatjs` 8.1.1, A-13): it parses each descriptor's `defaultMessage` with the ICU parser and reports `parseError` when parsing fails. It finds descriptors through the same `settings.formatjs.additionalFunctionNames: ["t"]` (A-12), so inline `t({…})` is covered. Lands in **S-0**; part of TP-0.22's smoke list, and TP-11.21 checks malformed and valid messages. | F-1 rule 4, S-0, TP-0.22, TP-11.21 | none (implements HLD D-37) | planner decision |
| A-19 | TP-0.20 (b) can't detect a peer problem: `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` skips resolution, so pnpm never prints its peer report, and it passes even with formatjs 5.4.2. `pnpm install --fix-lockfile` does print it; the test-architect added "TP-0.20x" with a resolving install in a clean clone (test-architect, S-0). | **(b) becomes the resolving install**, and TP-0.20x is folded into it (renamed TP-0.20): in a fresh clone of `HEAD`, `pnpm install --fix-lockfile` must exit 0 with no `Issues with peer dependencies found` and no `unmet peer` in its output. A new (c) keeps the frozen install (`--frozen-lockfile` exits 0 in a fresh clone), which is what CI runs. | TP-0.20 | none | planner decision |
| A-20 | TP-11.22: `<button><Icon name="x"/></button>` triggers no rule, because jsx-a11y 6.10.2 treats a childless capitalised component as possibly labelled (test-architect, S-11a; probed on ESLint 10.12.0). | F-1 sets `settings["jsx-a11y"].components = { Icon: "svg" }`, so the registry's `Icon` (F-215) is analysed as an `svg` element and no longer counts as a label, and `control-has-associated-label` gets `labelAttributes: ["label"]`, so `<Icon name="x" label="Close"/>` (F-215 renders that as `role="img"` with `aria-label`) does label a button. `ignoreElements: ["input", "select", "textarea"]` is added to the same rule, because with the default options it also reports every correctly labelled form field (`<label for="a">` with `<input id="a"/>`, and inputs nested in a `<label>`); field labels are `label-has-associated-control`'s job. I probed this on ESLint 10.12.0 and jsx-a11y 6.10.2: (3) in TP-11.22 reports, and (4), (5), (6), (10) and (11) don't. Other components stay "possibly labelled" (the plugin's default); Playwright's axe report (D-39) covers what static analysis can't see. Lands in **S-0** (F-1 config) and is tested in **S-11a**. | F-1 rule 4, TP-11.22, TP-0.22 | none | planner decision |
| A-21 | jsx-a11y checks React attribute names: `label-has-associated-control` looks for `htmlFor`, not Solid's `for`; `tabindex`, `aria-*` and `role` already work (test-architect, S-11a). | **Plugin setting, no Budmon rule:** F-1 sets `settings["jsx-a11y"].attributes = { for: ["for"] }` (supported by 6.10.2's `label-has-associated-control`). So `<label for="a">` counts as associated and `htmlFor`, which Solid doesn't map to `for`, doesn't. No other blocking rule depends on a React-only name: `tabindex` and `aria-*`/`role` are matched case-insensitively, and none of the eight rules reads `className`. `eslint-plugin-solid` has no accessibility rules, so switching isn't an option.

| A-25 | A-2 left the email canary path to identity's additions to `canaryFlows.test.ts`; identity asks for a defined rehearsal sub-step (identity PA-10). | **Sub-step 7b `email-canary`** in F-195 (harness code, so it ships with S-16; this replaces A-2's "added to `canaryFlows.test.ts` by identity's build"): accept the bootstrap invitation with a password and `tokenDelivery "body"`; invite `canaries.email` as the owner (bearer, `Idempotency-Key`); request a password reset for the owner; poll Mailpit's API for up to 60 s at its **published** `http://127.0.0.1:8025/api/v1/` (the harness runs on the runner host, outside `mail-ui`); extract every `#t=` token. The owner's password, the session tokens and the mail tokens become needles; `canaries.email` is already a CANARIES member. **Conflict resolved:** sub-step 7a bootstraps the owner as `REHEARSAL_OWNER_EMAIL = "rehearsal-owner.7f3a@example.invalid"` (a needle), not `canaries.email` as A-6 had it, because 7b invites the canary address (`ALREADY_A_USER` otherwise) and 7c needs that address to have no user. Upgrade fixtures (`apps/server/test/upgrade/<version>/fixtures.sql`) contain no owner, so 7a can run on upgraded databases. Skipped when 7a was skipped or accept answers `404 NOT_FOUND`.

(b) **`ApiContainer.moduleRoutes: ((app: FastifyInstance) => void)[]`** (default `[]`), registered by F-55's new step 4b, after the health routes and before the `/api/v1/*` catch-all. (c) The **`identity` member isn't declared by the platform** (its type is identity's): identity's S-0 adds `identity: IdentityModule` to `ApiContainer` and `WorkerContainer`, builds it after `sealedColumns`, and sets `authHook` and `erasureHandler` from it. The platform declares `WorkerContainer.erasureHandler: ErasureHandler \| null` (default `null`; F-146 and F-151 already used it) and keeps `authHook = noAuthHook` by default; `overrides` of either win over a module's value. (d) **`WorkerContainer.onGeneralStarted: (() => Promise<void>)[]`** (default `[]`), run by new **F-78b `runGeneralStartHooks`**, which F-91 calls after `startWorkers`: general role only, in array order, each once; a rejecting hook is reported and logged (`worker_start_hook_failed`, `step "onGeneralStarted:<index>"`) and the remaining hooks still run. (e) **`BaseContainer.sealedColumns: SealedColumnRegistry`** (F-115; the type gets this name), created before any module in both containers; `secrets:rewrap-api` calls new `rewrapApiSecretsCommand(c)` (F-117's file), which passes `c.sealedColumns.all()`; F-118 reads the worker container's registry.

That's the header a browser running this release would send. 7a and 7b use body delivery and send no header.

Dev dependency **`@vitest/coverage-v8` 5.0.3** at the root, always the same version as `vitest`. The root `vitest.config.ts` (test-architect's) sets `test.coverage = { provider: "v8", include: ["packages/shared/src/money/**"], reporter: ["text-summary"], reportsDirectory: "coverage", thresholds: { "packages/shared/src/money/**": { branches: 100 } } }`. New root script **`test:coverage`** = `vitest run --project=shared --coverage` (S-1). `check` becomes `pnpm format:check && pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck && pnpm test && pnpm test:coverage && pnpm test:int`, and S-1 adds `pnpm test:coverage` after `pnpm test` in `ci.yml`'s `check` job. Below 100 % the script exits non-zero, failing both. Coverage of other areas isn't measured. Lands in **S-1**. | §2.2.2, §2.4, §10.1 (scripts, CI jobs), S-1, TP-1.15 (new) | none | planner decision |

| A-37 | Format vectors depend on the CLDR data shipped with Node's ICU and with Android's ICU, which can differ (test-architect, S-1). | **Not tied to a CLDR or ICU version.** `format.json` holds only cases whose output is stable across current CLDR releases: locales `en-US` and `de-DE`, `currencyDisplay: "code"` only (no symbols), `signDisplay` `auto`, EGP, JPY and KWD, positive and negative. Expected strings are stored with U+00A0 and U+202F replaced by U+0020, and both suites normalise the same way before comparing. **A mismatch fails, on both platforms; nothing is skipped.** Node's ICU is fixed by `.nvmrc` and Robolectric's by its configured SDK, so a failure means a real change (a runtime upgrade or a bug). It's resolved by amendment: fix the code, or remove the case as CLDR-sensitive. **Android:** TP-13.9 runs `format.json` against F-256's `formatMoney` under Robolectric, with the same normalisation. Real devices may differ in display details only, and that isn't tested. Lands in **S-1** (TypeScript) and **S-13** (Android). | F-313, TP-1.8, TP-1.10, TP-13.9 | none | planner decision |

Only an object **property** whose value is `undefined` is omitted, as F-306 already says. `canonicalJson` feeds hashes and signed tokens (F-100, F-104, F-142, F-146), so a value that `JSON.stringify` would silently turn into `null` (changing the array's meaning) or drop must fail loudly instead. | F-306, TP-1.9 | none | planner decision |
| A-39 | F-312 `resolveLocale`'s "then the language subtag" step: should a requested `en` match a supported `en-US`?

"en"`; `requested` null or empty goes straight to (3). Examples: `ar-EG` with `["en","ar"]` → `ar`; `en` with `["en-US"]` → `en-US`; `en-GB` with `["en-US","en"]` → `en`; `pt` with `["pt-BR","pt-PT"]` → `pt-BR`; `fr` with `["en"]` → `en`. | F-312, TP-1.13 | none | planner decision |
| A-40 | F-312 `directionOf("ar-XB")`: the engineer has no special case because `ar` is RTL (software-engineer, S-1). | **Confirmed.** The language subtag (the part before the first `-`, lower-cased) decides; `ar-XB` is RTL through `ar`, and `en-XA` is LTR through `en`.

| A-41 | F-311 `isUuid`: "any lower-case RFC 9562 UUID" is ambiguous; the engineer accepts versions 1 to 8 with variant `[89ab]`, lower case only, and rejects nil and max (software-engineer, S-1). | **Confirmed**, as the exact rule: `^[0-9a-f]{8}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[1-8][0-9a-f]{3}-[89ab][0-9a-f]{3}-[0-9a-f]{12}$`. Nil (`00000000-…`) and max (`ffffffff-…`) don't match and are rejected; so are upper case, braces, a `urn:uuid:` prefix and undashed forms.

| A-42 | F-310 `isValidTimeZone`: the engineer accepts whatever `Intl.DateTimeFormat` accepts except `Etc/Unknown`, and ignores names only the polyfill might know (software-engineer, S-1). | **Confirmed, with one addition:** `isValidTimeZone(zone)` is true when `zone` is a non-empty string, `new Intl.DateTimeFormat("en", { timeZone: zone })` doesn't throw, the zone isn't `Etc/Unknown`, and it **isn't an offset string** (starts with `+` or `-`). Current `Intl` also accepts offsets such as `+02:00`, but they have no daylight-saving rules, so they're not valid user time zones. Names are matched as `Intl` matches them (case-insensitive; callers store the canonical `resolvedOptions().timeZone`). The polyfill reads zone data from the same `Intl`, so there are no polyfill-only names to consider. `todayIn` uses the same check. | F-310, TP-1.11 | none | planner decision |
| A-43 | G-1 (S-1 code review): `@budmon/shared` exports `./src/index.ts` with `./x.js` specifiers, which Vitest, tsx and Vite resolve but plain Node doesn't, so the image's `node dist/main/api.js` couldn't import it. How is the server built and how are workspace packages consumed in production? | **The server image runs an esbuild bundle.** New **F-24 `buildServer`** (`apps/server/scripts/build.ts`, package script `build` = `tsx scripts/build.ts`) bundles the entry points `src/main/{api,worker,migrate,cli,healthcheck}.ts` into `dist/main/`. Every `@budmon/*` workspace package (and the dependencies only they use) is **bundled from source**; the server's own `package.json` `dependencies` stay **external** and are installed in the image. Workspace packages keep their source `exports` (`types` and `default` → `./src/index.ts`), so typecheck, ESLint, Vitest, tsx and Vite need no build step and no custom condition; no package has a `dist`. `@budmon/*` packages are `devDependencies` of `@budmon/server`, so a production install doesn't fetch them. **Runtime files:** JSON reference data (`platform/fx/iso4217.json`) is imported with `with { type: "json" }` and inlined; folders and non-JSON files (the `drizzle/` migrations folder, module assets such as identity's `assets/common-100k.txt.gz`) are located through new **F-25 `serverRoot()`**, which finds the `@budmon/server` package root in source and bundle alike; the image keeps `package.json`, `dist/`, `drizzle/` and each module's `assets/` at that root. **Slices:** S-2 (F-24, F-25, the `build` script; TP-2.6 runs the bundle); S-15's Dockerfile runs `pnpm --filter @budmon/server build`. **Web:** unchanged, Vite bundles `@budmon/shared` from source. **Android:** nothing to build; it doesn't consume TypeScript, and only reads `packages/shared/test-vectors/` as test resources (F-313). **Recorded:** the root `package.json` dev dependency `@budmon/shared: "workspace:*"` (added in S-1 for TP-1.14) belongs in §2.2. `esbuild` is a dev dependency of `@budmon/server`, pinned exactly when S-2 is built (A-32's `ignoredBuiltDependencies` stays). | §2.2 (`package.json`), §2.3, §2.4, F-18 note, F-21 note, F-24 (new), F-25 (new), F-92, S-2, S-15, TP-2.6, TP-2.27 (new), TP-2.28 (new) | none | planner decision |
| A-44 | N-1 (S-1 code review): `Rational` is a plain interface, so hand-built values with `den <= 0n` get past `convertWithRates` and `roundHalfEven`. | As the engineer built it: every function that takes a `Rational` (`roundHalfEven`, `toFixedDecimalString`, `multiplyByRational`, `convertWithRates`) first passes it through `rational(num, den)`. `den === 0n` → `RangeError("Zero denominator")` (also `rational`'s own error). A negative `den` is normalised to an equal value (`{ num: 1n, den: -1n }` → −1/1). The result is then judged as a value: `roundHalfEven` accepts it, and `convertWithRates` rejects it as a non-positive rate (`RangeError`, F-303). An unreduced value is reduced.

Two cheap additions: `minor` and `currency` are defined as **non-enumerable**, read-only own properties, so `Object.keys(m)` is `[]` and `{ ...m }` is `{}`; and `Money.of` throws `TypeError("Invalid currency code")` when `currency` doesn't match `^[A-Z]{3}$` (the same rule as `asCurrencyCode`), since the brand is compile-time only.

| A-48 | E-3/E-4 (S-1 QA, optional): `canonicalJson` rejects plain objects from another realm, overflows the stack on very deep input, and gives no key path in errors. | **Depth cap:** nesting deeper than **100** levels of objects and arrays throws `TypeError("Structure too deep")` before the stack runs out (request bodies are at most 100 KiB, and `[[[…]]]` could otherwise turn an idempotent create into an `INTERNAL` error). **No change** to realm handling: Budmon never passes `vm` or iframe objects, and rejecting them is the safe failure. **No change** to messages: they name no key path, because keys can be user-supplied record keys and the error must stay value-free. | F-306, TP-1.9 | none | planner decision |
| A-49 | F-19's steps 3 and 6 and its `jobRegistry` input belong to S-6: what are `runSchemaStep`'s input and report in S-2? (test-architect, S-2) | **S-2:** `runSchemaStep(input: { mode; database; migrationsFolder; roleSecrets; appEnv; referenceData; logger })`, steps 1 (F-15), 2 (F-17 or F-18), 4 (F-16 without the `pgboss` default privileges) and 5 (F-21); report `{ migrationsApplied, pushedStatements, currenciesUpserted }`. **S-6 extends it:** adds `jobRegistry: JobRegistry` to the input, steps 3 (F-74) and 6 (F-75), the `pgboss` default privileges in step 4, and the report fields `queueSchema`, `queuesCreated`, `queuesUpdated`. S-6's tests extend TP-2.15's expectations with those fields. | F-19, S-2, S-6, TP-2.15 | none | planner decision |
| A-50 | TP-2.15 runs push mode twice, but F-17 throws `PushTargetNotEmptyError` on a non-empty database (test-architect, S-2). | F-17 is right: push mode is for empty databases only (F-20 drops first; F-22 pushes only when `budmon` doesn't exist). TP-2.15 becomes: (a) push on an empty database → the report; (b) push again → `PushTargetNotEmptyError`, after step 1 re-ran idempotently; (c) **migrate mode** with an empty migrations fixture (journal with no entries) on the pushed database → `migrationsApplied: 0`, `currenciesUpserted: 0`, which is the idempotency check. | F-19, TP-2.15 | none | planner decision |
| A-51 | F-15 logs `role_password_set` but has no logger; TP-2.10 (a)'s span and log checks need S-3's telemetry (test-architect, S-2). | F-15's signature gains `logger: Logger` (last parameter); it logs `info("role_password_set", { role })` once per role. The **`Logger` interface** (F-31's type only) is created in S-2 in `platform/observability/logger.ts`; `createLogger` arrives in S-3. S-2's tests pass a recording fake. TP-2.10 (a) keeps the `pg_stat_statements` and log checks (with the fake logger) in S-2; the **span** check moves to new **TP-3.12** in S-3, where the real tracer exists. F-15 still wraps the statements in `suppressTracing` from S-2 (a no-op without an SDK). The same applies to F-19's `logger` (A-49). | F-15, F-19, F-31, S-2, S-3, TP-2.10, TP-3.12 (new) | none | planner decision |
| A-52 | `SchemaStepError`'s field names aren't specified; the tests assume `code` and `subject` (test-architect, S-2). | Confirmed: `export class SchemaStepError extends Error { readonly code: SchemaStepCode; readonly subject: string \| undefined; constructor(code: SchemaStepCode, subject?: string) }`, `SchemaStepCode` the union of §6's codes. `name` is `"SchemaStepError"`; `message` is `schema step failed: <code>`, plus ` (<subject>)` when given. Subjects are role, table, queue or currency names, never values. | §6, TP-2.10 | none | planner decision |
| A-53 | S-2 AC-3 ("no superuser except in the global setup") conflicts with TP-2.9, TP-2.16 and F-20, which connect as superuser (test-architect, S-2). | AC-3 becomes: "Tests connect as a superuser only to bootstrap or reset a database: the global setup, and the F-14 and F-20 cases (TP-2.9, TP-2.16 (b), TP-2.29), each on its own fresh container. Every other integration test connects as a non-superuser role." | S-2 | none | planner decision |
| A-54 | TP-2.16's "dependencies called in order" is a unit test with fakes, but F-20 really drops and recreates the database; and `deps.seed` takes a `WorkerContainer`, which doesn't exist in S-2 (test-architect, S-2). | `deps.seed` becomes `() => Promise<void>` (as in `seedDevelopmentDatabase`); F-94 supplies the closure (build a worker container from the development config, F-23 `runSeeders`, close; the platform's `seeders` list is empty until S-9 adds `platform.fx-rates`). TP-2.16 splits: (a) **unit**, guard cases with fakes, `ResetRefusedError` and no dependency called; (b) **integration** on a fresh container: a marker table in the old database is gone, `runSchemaStep` (spied, real) was called once with `mode: "push"`, then `seed` once; with `seed: false` it isn't called. | F-20, F-94, TP-2.16 | none | planner decision |
| A-55 | TP-2.18 needs `/health/ready` (F-57, S-4), so it can't pass in S-2 (test-architect, S-2). | **TP-2.18 (S-2)** checks only what S-2 delivers: from a fresh clone, `pnpm dev` creates `.data/dev-secrets/*`, starts Postgres, and creates and pushes database `budmon` (the four platform tables exist) within 90 s. **New TP-4.23 (S-4)** takes the old case: `/health/ready` answers 200 within 90 s. The CI `dev-smoke` job runs TP-2.18 from S-2 and TP-4.23 from S-4. S-2 AC-1 is read the same way. | S-2, S-4, §10.1 CI jobs, TP-2.18, TP-4.23 (new) | none | planner decision |
| A-56 | TP-2.27 expects `healthcheck.js`, which is S-6's (test-architect, S-2). | F-24's entry points are **every `src/main/*.ts` that exists, except the development-only `dev.ts` and `dbReset.ts`**. S-2 builds `api`, `worker` and `migrate`; S-6 adds `cli` (F-93) and `healthcheck`, and extends TP-2.27's expected list. | F-24, TP-2.27 | none | planner decision |
| A-57 | `Config` has no field for the API's `GOOGLE_OAUTH_REDIRECT_ORIGIN` (default `PUBLIC_ORIGIN`), nor for SMTP's implicit TLS, port and plaintext (test-architect, S-2). | `Config.api.googleOAuthRedirectOrigin: URL` (the variable, or `PUBLIC_ORIGIN`'s origin when unset); `Config.capture.oauth.redirectOrigin: URL` (required with the client id). `Config.email.smtpTransport: { security: "implicit_tls" \| "starttls" \| "none"; host: string; port: number; user?: string }`, derived from `SMTP_URL`: `smtps` → `implicit_tls`, default port 465; `smtp` → `starttls`, default 587, except `none` for the plaintext hosts F-10 allows (`mailpit`, and `localhost`/`127.0.0.1` in development and test). `email.smtpUrl` stays. | F-10 (`Config`), TP-2.21, TP-2.22 | none | planner decision |
| A-58 | F-94's testable entry isn't defined: how F-20's functions are injected, where `appEnv` and `roles.json` come from, and whether argv is checked before files are read (test-architect, S-2). | `export async function runDbResetCli(argv: readonly string[], deps: { env: Readonly<Record<string, string \| undefined>>; readFile: (path: string) => string; resetDevelopmentDatabase: typeof resetDevelopmentDatabase; seedDevelopmentDatabase: typeof seedDevelopmentDatabase; seedAll: () => Promise<void>; stderr: (line: string) => void }): Promise<number>` in `main/dbReset.ts`, with an entry guard as in F-6 passing `process.env`. Order: (1) **argv first**, before any read: only `--seed-only` and `--no-seed`; both → exit 64 with F-94's message; another argument → `Unknown argument: <arg>`, exit 64. (2) `DEV_SUPERUSER_URL` from `env`; missing → `DEV_SUPERUSER_URL is not set`, exit 64. `appEnv` = `env.APP_ENV` (default `development`).

(4) Otherwise reads `env.ROLE_SECRETS_FILE` (default `.data/dev-secrets/roles.json`, relative to the repository root `join(serverRoot(), "../..")`), takes `budmon_migrator`'s password from it, `databaseName = env.DB_NAME ?? "budmon"`, and calls `resetDevelopmentDatabase` with `seed: !argv.includes("--no-seed")` and `deps.seed = deps.seedAll`. Exit codes as F-94. A `ResetRefusedError` writes its message (A-84) as one stderr line and returns 2; any other error goes through `runCommand` (`"db:reset"` or `"db:seed"`), one A-81 line, return 1 (A-91).

| A-59 | `DEV_SUPERUSER_URL` is in `.env.example` (F-20) but not in F-10's table, so `checkEnvExample` reports it as unknown (test-architect, S-2). | F-10's table gains `DEV_SUPERUSER_URL` with kind **"development tools only (F-20, F-22, F-94); not part of any `Config`"**; `allConfigKeys()` includes it, and `configSchemaFor` ignores it. `.env.example`: `postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres`. | F-10, TP-2.7 | none | planner decision |
| A-60 | F-25 caches its first result; is the cache per `fromUrl`? (test-architect, S-2) | **Per start directory**: a `Map` from the directory of `fromUrl` to the result, so different trees in tests resolve independently. A not-found result isn't cached. | F-25, TP-2.28 | none | planner decision |
| A-61 | §10.1 wants the test Postgres image to use the same digest as `images/postgres`'s base, which arrives in S-15; the test-architect pinned `postgres:18@sha256:74935e72…` (test-architect, S-2). | **Confirmed.** Until S-15 the source of truth is `apps/server/test/setup/postgresImage.ts` (test-architect's), exporting `POSTGRES_IMAGE = "postgres:18@sha256:<64 hex>"`. S-15's `images/postgres/Dockerfile` starts with `FROM ${POSTGRES_IMAGE}`'s exact value, and new **TP-15.30** fails when the two references differ.

| A-62 | TP-2.27 requires every bare specifier in the bundle to be a `node:` builtin, but bundled dependencies import unprefixed builtins such as `fs` (test-architect, S-2). | Acceptable. A bare specifier left in the bundle must be a **Node builtin, with or without `node:`** (`module.isBuiltin(spec)`), or a key of `dependencies` (or a subpath of one). Our own code still uses `node:` (not enforced). | TP-2.27 | none | planner decision |
| A-63 | F-22 doesn't say where `DEV_SUPERUSER_URL` comes from in a fresh clone without `.env`, which S-2 AC-1 and TP-2.18 need (test-architect, S-2). | **`pnpm dev` copies `.env.example` to `.env` when `.env` is missing**, then loads it. Copying (rather than defaulting one variable) gives the API, the workers and `db:*` (A-58's `--env-file-if-exists=../../.env`) the same complete development configuration, and leaves the developer a file to edit. New `export function ensureDevEnv(repoRoot: string, processEnv: Readonly<Record<string, string \| undefined>>, deps: { exists(path: string): boolean; copyFile(from: string, to: string): void; readFile(path: string): string; log(line: string): void }): Record<string, string>` in `main/dev.ts`: if `<repoRoot>/.env` doesn't exist, copies `.env.example` byte for byte and logs `Created .env from .env.example`; an existing `.env` is never overwritten. Then parses `.env` with `node:util`'s `parseEnv` and returns it merged under `processEnv` (a variable already set in the shell wins). F-22 runs it first and uses the result for its own `DEV_SUPERUSER_URL` and as the environment of every process it starts. `.env` stays git-ignored. | F-22, TP-2.18, TP-2.31 (new) | none | planner decision |
| A-64 | `db:reset`: §2.2.2 (A-58) says `tsx --env-file-if-exists=../../.env`; the test pins plain `tsx src/main/dbReset.ts`; the engineer made `dbReset.ts` load `<repo>/.env` itself when run directly (software-engineer, S-2). | **The engineer's and the test's form wins.** Package scripts: `db:reset` = `tsx src/main/dbReset.ts`, `db:seed` = `tsx src/main/dbReset.ts --seed-only`. `dbReset.ts`'s entry guard reads `join(serverRoot(), "../../.env")` when it exists, parses it with `node:util` `parseEnv`, merges it **under** `process.env` (the shell wins), and passes the result as `runDbResetCli`'s `env`. It never creates `.env`; that's `pnpm dev`'s job (A-63), the documented first command. Without `.env` and without `DEV_SUPERUSER_URL` in the shell, the CLI exits 64 as A-58 says. Keeping the loading in code makes `node`/`tsx` invocations behave the same, with no flag to forget. | §2.2.2, F-94, A-58 superseded on this point | none | planner decision |
| A-65 | Testcontainers brings `cpu-features`, `protobufjs` and `ssh2`, which print "Ignored build scripts"; TP-0.20 pins `pnpm-workspace.yaml`'s list to `[esbuild]`, so the engineer listed all four under the root `package.json` `pnpm.ignoredBuiltDependencies` (software-engineer, S-2). | **One place: `pnpm-workspace.yaml`**, next to the other pnpm settings, with `ignoredBuiltDependencies: ["cpu-features", "esbuild", "protobufjs", "ssh2"]` (sorted). The root `package.json` has no `pnpm` field. None of the three scripts is needed: `ssh2`/`cpu-features` build optional native speed-ups for Docker over SSH (Testcontainers uses the local socket), and `protobufjs`'s script only prints a version notice. A-32's rule stands (a new dependency with a build script goes into one of the two lists by amendment). TP-0.20 is updated. | §2.2 (`pnpm-workspace.yaml`), A-32, TP-0.20 | none | planner decision |
| A-66 | `@budmon/config`'s export `./tsconfig/*` doesn't resolve `extends: "@budmon/config/tsconfig/node.json"`; the engineer changed it to `./tsconfig/*.json` (software-engineer, S-2). | **Confirmed.** `exports["./tsconfig/*.json"] = "./tsconfig/*.json"`; consumers write the `.json` suffix. | §2.2 (`packages/config/`) | none | planner decision |
| A-67 | `apps/server/tsconfig.json` gained `scripts/**/*.ts` (a test imports F-24's script) and `resolveJsonModule` (software-engineer, S-2). | **Confirmed.** A-30's server tsconfig becomes `include: ["src/**/*.ts", "scripts/**/*.ts", "test/**/*.ts", "drizzle.config.ts"]` with `resolveJsonModule: true` (needed for A-43's JSON import of `iso4217.json`). | §2.3, A-30 | none | planner decision |
| A-68 | `schemaStep.ts` loads `schemaPush` through a dynamic import with a variable specifier, so the bundle never pulls in `drizzle-kit` (software-engineer, S-2). | **Confirmed and recorded.** F-19 loads F-17 only in push mode, as `await import(pushModule)` with `const pushModule = "./schemaPush.js"` held in a variable, which esbuild leaves unresolved; push mode therefore works under tsx and Vitest only, which is where it's used (development and test). `drizzle-kit` stays a dev dependency. TP-2.27 also checks that no bundle file contains `drizzle-kit`. | F-17, F-19, TP-2.27 | none | planner decision |
| A-69 | `iso4217.json` (207 entries): names are CLDR English names from Node's ICU, not the official ISO names; minor units follow ISO for active currencies. Specify the sources (software-engineer, S-2). | **Sources:** codes, the `active` flag and `minorUnits` of active currencies come from **ISO 4217 List One** (current currencies, published by SIX, the maintenance agency); withdrawn currencies that the file keeps come from **List Three** (historic), with its minor units where given and 2 otherwise. Funds and precious-metal codes stay excluded (TP-2.14). **Names** are CLDR English display names (`new Intl.DisplayNames("en", { type: "currency" }).of(code)` on Node 24), chosen because they're what users read elsewhere in the UI; they're display text only and never compared. The file is committed data; regenerating it is a reviewed change, and F-21 refuses a `minorUnits` change for a stored currency. | §3.4 (reference data), TP-2.14 | none | planner decision |
| A-70 | Mailpit is pinned by digest only in `infra/compose.yaml` (`axllent/mailpit:v1.27@sha256:e22dce5b…`). Does it belong elsewhere, and should a test check it? (software-engineer, S-2) | It belongs in **both** Compose files that run it: `infra/compose.yaml` (development, S-2) and `infra/local/compose.main.yaml` (the laptop, S-15, A-2), with the **same** `image:` reference. Tests: **TP-2.32** (S-2): every `image:` in `infra/compose.yaml` is pinned by `@sha256:<64 hex>`, and its Postgres reference equals `POSTGRES_IMAGE` (A-61); **TP-15.31** (S-15): the Mailpit references in the two files are identical, and every `image:` in the laptop's Compose files is digest-pinned. | §2.3, §2.4, S-15, TP-2.32 (new), TP-15.31 (new) | none | planner decision |
| A-71 | `Config.migrate.previousPassword` is new and optional, for F-92's `28P01` fallback (software-engineer, S-2). | **Confirmed.** `Config.migrate` gains `previousPassword?: Secret<string>`, read from `DB_PASSWORD_PREVIOUS_FILE` (kind `migrate`, optional, already in F-10's table); absent when the variable is unset. | F-10 (`Config`), F-92, TP-2.1 | none | planner decision |
| A-72 | `seedAll` skips building a worker container while the seeder list is empty (until S-9) (software-engineer, S-2). | **Confirmed.** `seedAll` returns immediately when `seeders.length === 0`, so `db:seed` and `db:reset` don't need a complete worker configuration before any seeder exists. From S-9 it builds the container, runs `runSeeders` and closes it. | F-94, TP-2.29 | none | planner decision |
| A-73 | B-3 (S-2 code review, blocking): `dev.ts` starts the api and worker with cwd `apps/server`, but `.env`'s `*_FILE` paths (from `.env.example`) are relative to the repository root, so both exit 78. | **Option (a), as a rule: every development server process runs with the repository root as its working directory.** F-22 step 4 starts `tsx watch --tsconfig apps/server/tsconfig.json apps/server/src/main/api.ts` and the same for `worker.ts`, with `cwd: repoRoot` (Vite keeps `apps/web`). `dbReset.ts`'s entry guard calls `process.chdir(join(serverRoot(), "../.."))` before anything else, so `db:reset`/`db:seed` (A-64) and, from S-9, `seedAll`'s worker configuration resolve the same paths; A-58's explicit `ROLE_SECRETS_FILE` resolution against the root stays correct. F-11 keeps resolving relative paths against the working directory (no special case). **Production and rehearsal:** every `*_FILE` value must be an **absolute** path (new prod rule in F-10, problem "must be an absolute path"); the laptop's Compose files already use `/run/secrets/…`. Options (b) and (c) were rejected: (b) would need a list of which non-`_FILE` variables are paths (`OBJECT_STORE_FS_ROOT`), and (c) would make `.env.example` machine-specific. | F-10, F-22, F-94, TP-2.18, TP-2.33 (new) | none | planner decision |
| A-74 | B-1 (S-2 code review): `pg-connection-string` lets `?host=` and `?hostaddr=` override the URL's host, bypassing F-20's localhost check. The engineer checks the effective host and refuses those parameters. | **Confirmed, and stated in F-20 step 1:** the guard parses `superuserUrl` with `pg-connection-string`'s `parse` (the parser `pg` uses) and refuses, with `ResetRefusedError` and before any connection: any `host` or `hostaddr` query parameter; a host list (a comma in the host); a socket path (a host starting with `/`); and any effective host not in `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `::1`, `host.docker.internal` (the former `TESTCONTAINERS=1` exception is replaced by the explicit `allowNonLocalHost` input, A-79). The same guard serves `seedDevelopmentDatabase`. | F-20, TP-2.16 | none | planner decision |
| A-75 | N-1 (S-2 code review): `cluster-bootstrap.sql` expects a pre-quoted `:migrator_password_sql`, uses `\connect :dbname`, and the password travels in psql's argv. | **Fixed now, in S-2** (the file exists; S-15's F-170 only copies it). The file reads the password from the environment, `\getenv migrator_password BUDMON_MIGRATOR_PASSWORD`, and uses `ALTER ROLE budmon_migrator PASSWORD :'migrator_password';` (psql quotes the literal); it connects with `\connect :"dbname"`; `dbname` still comes from `-v dbname=<name>` (not secret). An unset `BUDMON_MIGRATOR_PASSWORD` stops the script (`ON_ERROR_STOP`) before any change. F-14 in Node doesn't run the file; it issues the same statements with `escapeLiteral`/`escapeIdentifier`. F-170 sets `BUDMON_MIGRATOR_PASSWORD` for the psql call (S-15). New TP-2.34. | F-14, F-170, TP-2.34 (new) | none | planner decision |
| A-76 | N-3 (S-2 code review): the code accepts `PUBLIC_ORIGIN=http://localhost:…` and an absent `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` for worker-capture under `APP_ENV=test`, where F-10 allows them only in development. | **Extend the rules to `test`**, which runs only on developer machines and CI and needs the same local origins: `PUBLIC_ORIGIN` allows `http://localhost:<port>` in development **and test**; `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` is optional in development **and test** and for the api (matching `GOOGLE_SIGNIN_CLIENT_ID`). Prod rules are unchanged. | F-10, TP-2.35 (new) | none | planner decision |
| A-77 | N-5 (S-2 code review): F-15 creates only missing roles, so an existing role with stronger attributes (SUPERUSER, CREATEDB, INHERIT) keeps them. Normalise? | **Check and refuse, not normalise.** `budmon_migrator` (CREATEROLE, not superuser) can't remove `SUPERUSER`, `REPLICATION` or `BYPASSRLS` from another role, so normalising can't be complete. Before any statement, F-15 reads `pg_roles` for every existing login role and requires exactly: `budmon_app`, `budmon_capture`, `budmon_queue`, `budmon_monitor`: LOGIN, NOSUPERUSER, NOCREATEDB, NOCREATEROLE, NOINHERIT, NOREPLICATION, NOBYPASSRLS; `budmon_migrator`: the same except CREATEROLE. Any difference throws `SchemaStepError("role_attributes_unexpected", role)` and nothing is altered; an operator with superuser rights fixes the role. | F-15, §6, TP-2.10 | none | planner decision |
| A-78 | A-69 follow-up (S-2 code review): CLDR's English names are inconsistently cased (`XCG` "Caribbean guilder"). | **Noted; names stay verbatim from CLDR**, no re-casing rule: any rule would mangle names such as "CFA Franc BCEAO", and the names are display text only. A later CLDR fix arrives with a reviewed regeneration (A-69). | §3.4 | none | planner decision |
| A-79 | G-1 (S-2 round-2 review): F-20's `TESTCONTAINERS=1` override is ambient: any environment that holds it (a shell profile, a CI runner, a wrapper, formerly `.env`) disables the host check. Its only legitimate user is TP-2.16 (b), which runs F-20 in-process. | **Replaced by an explicit input.** `resetDevelopmentDatabase` and `seedDevelopmentDatabase` take `allowNonLocalHost?: boolean` (default `false`). When `true`, only the host **allowlist** is skipped; the `appEnv` check (development or test) and A-74's refusals (`host`/`hostaddr` query parameters, host lists, socket paths) still apply. F-20 never reads `process.env`. F-94 (`runDbResetCli`) never sets the input, and nothing in application code does; only TP-2.16 (b) passes `true`, for the Testcontainers host. No environment variable can widen the guard. A-74's "unless `TESTCONTAINERS=1`" is superseded. | F-20, A-74, TP-2.16, TP-2.24, TP-2.29 | none | planner decision |
| A-80 | S-2 QA defect: `apps/server/drizzle/` holds only `.gitkeep`, F-18 requires `meta/_journal.json`, so `pnpm db:migrate` and `node dist/main/migrate.js` exit 1. | **A missing journal means zero migrations.** Shipping a baseline journal was rejected: it's a file under `apps/server/drizzle/`, which F-6 forbids outside release branches, and the first release migration (F-180) creates the journal anyway. F-18: `readJournal` returns `[]` when `meta/_journal.json` (or the folder) doesn't exist; `applyCommittedMigrations` then doesn't call Drizzle's `migrate` (which would throw); if `drizzle.__drizzle_migrations` holds rows, that's `UnknownMigrationError` (exit 4) as before, else `{ applied: 0, verified: 0 }`. F-57's readiness uses the same `readJournal`, so an empty journal with no migrations table is "ready". AC-2 becomes "No migration files exist (the folder holds only `.gitkeep`), and `pnpm db:migrate` succeeds with zero migrations." | F-18, F-57 note, F-92, S-2 AC-2, TP-2.13 | none | planner decision |
| A-81 | S-2 QA: F-92's "1 other" has no log shape; QA saw a bare `{"event":"startup_failed"}` for a bad password, an unreachable database and a missing journal; schema-step failures log the code but not A-52's `subject`. | New **F-26 `describeFailure`** (`platform/observability/describeFailure.ts`, S-2) returns `{ errorClass, errorCode?, reason? }`, every value passing F-30's `token` rule or left out: `errorClass` = the error's constructor name (`"NonError"` otherwise); `errorCode` = `SchemaStepError.code`, a Postgres SQLSTATE (`^[0-9A-Z]{5}$`) or a Node system code (`^E[A-Z0-9_]{1,30}$`); `reason` = `SchemaStepError.subject` or `ResetRefusedError.reason`.

| A-83 | S-2 QA: `db:reset`/`db:seed` load `.env` (A-64), but `db:migrate` and a direct `tsx apps/server/src/main/api.ts` don't; `db:migrate` needs `DB_USER=budmon_migrator` and a password file, neither in `.env.example`. | **Rule:** the development root scripts load `.env`; production entry points (`node dist/main/*.js`) never do. `pnpm dev` (A-63) and `db:reset`/`db:seed` (A-64) already do. **`db:migrate` in development:** package script `tsx src/main/devMigrate.ts`, a development-only wrapper (excluded from F-24's bundle like `dev.ts` and `dbReset.ts`): `process.chdir(<repo root>)`; applies `devMigrateEnv` to the **shell environment only** (`DB_USER=budmon_migrator`, `DB_PASSWORD_FILE=.data/dev-secrets/migrator_password` unless the shell sets them), lays that result over the parsed `.env` (`.env`'s own `DB_USER`/`DB_PASSWORD_FILE`, the api login, are overridden), then calls `runMigrate(env)` (wording corrected by A-94). F-92 exports `export async function runMigrate(env: Readonly<Record<string, string \| undefined>>): Promise<number>` (the exit code; its entry guard passes `process.env`). F-22 step 2 also writes `.data/dev-secrets/migrator_password` with `budmon_migrator`'s password from `roles.json`. A direct `tsx apps/server/src/main/api.ts` isn't a supported development command (use `pnpm dev`); the README says so (A-85). | §2.2.2 (`db:migrate`), F-22, F-24, F-92, TP-2.18, TP-2.38 (new) | none | planner decision |
| A-84 | S-2 QA: F-20's refusal message is identical for every reason. | **It names the reason, never the input.** `ResetRefusedError` gains `readonly reason: "app_env" \| "non_local_host" \| "host_parameter" \| "host_list" \| "socket_path" \| "unparseable_url"`. Message: `<base>: <phrase>`, where `<base>` is A-14's "db:reset only runs against a local development or test database" (or the `db:seed` form) and `<phrase>` is fixed per reason: `APP_ENV is <appEnv>` (an enum value, safe), `the host isn't local`, `the URL sets a host parameter`, `the URL lists several hosts`, `the URL is a socket path`, `the URL can't be parsed`.

| A-85 | S-2 QA: the README never mentions `pnpm dev`, `.env`, the `db:*` scripts, Mailpit or `.data/dev-secrets`, and says Docker is only for integration tests. | **S-2 owns these README sections, with these exact headings:** `## Prerequisites` (Docker for the development stack and integration tests, Node 24 from `.nvmrc`, pnpm through Corepack); `## First run` (`pnpm install`, then `pnpm dev`: creates `.env` from `.env.example` and `.data/dev-secrets/`, starts Postgres and Mailpit, pushes the database, starts api and worker; Ctrl-C stops them; Mailpit's inbox at the port in `infra/compose.yaml`); `## Configuration` (`.env`, relative paths from the repository root, never commit `.env` or `.data/`; `api.ts` isn't run directly); `## Database commands` (`db:reset`, `db:seed`, `db:migrate`, and that migrations exist only on release branches); `## Tests` (`test`, `test:int` (Docker), `test:coverage`, `check`); `## Layout`. **Later slices extend them:** S-4 (API URL, `/health/ready`, `contract:openapi`), S-11a/S-11b (web dev server, `test:e2e`), S-13 (Android), S-14 (release migrations), S-15 (a pointer to the stage-0 runbook). | §2.1/§2.2 (`README.md`), S-2, TP-2.40 (new) | none | planner decision |
| A-86 | S-2 QA defect F-1: `waitForPostgres` runs `pg_isready` through `docker compose exec`, which the image's socket-only init server also answers, so the next TCP query sometimes fails with `ECONNRESET`/`ECONNREFUSED` and a raw stack. | **Confirmed fix, in F-22 step 1:** `waitForPostgres(url, deps: { connect(url: string, timeoutMs: number): Promise<void>; sleep(ms: number): Promise<void>; now(): number }, opts?: { timeoutMs?: number; intervalMs?: number })` in `main/dev.ts` polls from the host over **TCP** with the same `DEV_SUPERUSER_URL` the tools use (`connect` opens a `pg` client with `connectionTimeoutMillis: 2000`, runs `SELECT 1`, closes), every 500 ms for up to 60 s. The init server listens only on the socket, so the first TCP success is the real server. Timeout → `Error("Postgres didn't become ready within 60 s")`. `dev.ts`'s `main` catches every error and prints A-81's line, exit 1. | F-22, TP-2.39 (new) | none | planner decision |
| A-87 | S-2 QA: everything so far ran on Node 22; the CI `check` job must use Node 24 from `.nvmrc`. | **Confirmed and pinned by a test:** every `actions/setup-node` step in every workflow uses `node-version-file: .nvmrc` and no `node-version`; `.nvmrc` is `24`. `ci.yml` already does this; new TP-0.25 keeps it so.

| A-88 | S-2 QA: the Compose project (`budmon-dev`) and ports are hardcoded, so parallel runs on one Docker daemon can't be isolated. | **No change: one development stack per Docker daemon.** Tests don't use it (Testcontainers picks random ports), and CI's `dev-smoke` has its own runner. Overrides would have to reach `.env`'s `DB_PORT`, `DEV_SUPERUSER_URL`, the SMTP URL and Vite's proxy consistently, which is more surface than one machine needs.

| A-89 | TP-2.39 (c): `dev.ts`'s `main` has no exported signature or injectable dependencies, so a test can't make it throw and check the one-line failure (test-architect). | F-26's file gains `export async function runCommand(command: string, fn: () => Promise<number \| void>, stderr: (line: string) => void): Promise<number>`: awaits `fn`; returns its number (or 0 when it returns nothing); if it throws, writes exactly one line `<command> failed: <errorClass>[ <errorCode>][ (<reason>)]` from `describeFailure` and returns 1. It never writes a stack. `dev.ts`'s entry guard is `process.exitCode = await runCommand("pnpm dev", () => startDev(…), line => process.stderr.write(line + "\n"))`; `devMigrate.ts` uses it with `"db:migrate"`; `runDbResetCli` uses it for unexpected errors (A-91).

(test-architect) | **The A-84 message only**, as the code and tests do now: `ResetRefusedError` is an expected outcome with its own exit code (2), and its message already names the reason without any secret. `runDbResetCli` writes `err.message` as one stderr line and returns 2.

| A-92 | CI `migrations` on PR #1 fails: F-6 reports `apps/server/drizzle/.gitkeep` as a changed migration file on `feat/platform`, contradicting A-80 and AC-2 (coordinator, CI). | **Option (a), narrowly:** F-6 ignores the one path `apps/server/drizzle/.gitkeep` (exact match, whether added, changed or deleted); every other path under `apps/server/drizzle/`, including any other `.gitkeep` or dotfile, still counts. Option (b) (no folder in git) was rejected: the image's Dockerfile (S-15) and F-25's runtime layout copy and expect `drizzle/`, and A-80 already treats an empty folder as zero migrations, so keeping the placeholder is the simpler contract.

An unknown value (anything else, including values with control characters) refuses with `ResetRefusedError` reason `app_env` and the **fixed** phrase `APP_ENV is not a known environment`; the value is never written. `APP_ENV is <appEnv>` is used only for a known `AppEnv` value.

| A-94 | N-2 (S-2 round-4 review): A-83 reads as "parse `.env` (shell wins), then `devMigrateEnv(env)`", which with `.env`'s `DB_USER=budmon_app` reproduces the bug fixed in `1ab4db1`. | **Order, as implemented:** `devMigrate.ts` computes `shell = devMigrateEnv(process.env)` on the **shell environment only** (A-90: a new object), then `env = { ...parsedDotEnv, ...shell }`, and calls `runMigrate(env)`. Effect: a `DB_USER`/`DB_PASSWORD_FILE` set in the shell wins; otherwise the migrator login (`budmon_migrator`, `.data/dev-secrets/migrator_password`); `.env` supplies everything else and its `DB_USER`/`DB_PASSWORD_FILE` (the api login) are never used by `db:migrate`. For testing, `devMigrate.ts` exports `export function buildDevMigrateEnv(shellEnv: Readonly<Record<string, string \| undefined>>, dotEnv: Readonly<Record<string, string>>): Record<string, string \| undefined>` with exactly this rule.

| A-95 | D-1 (S-2 QA): the README suggests `--` before a flag; pnpm 10.34.6 forwards the literal `--`, which `runDbResetCli` rejects (`Unknown argument: --`, exit 64). | **Both sides:** `runDbResetCli` ignores every argument that is exactly `--` (a separator, never meaningful here), and the README's `## Database commands` says `pnpm db:reset --no-seed` with no `--` and drops the "if your shell needs it" advice.

| A-97 | M-2 (S-2 QA): a wrong superuser password makes `pnpm dev` retry for 60 s and then print a bare `pnpm dev failed: Error`. | `waitForPostgres` **stops at once** when `connect` rejects with SQLSTATE `28P01` (invalid password) or `28000` (invalid authorisation), rethrowing that error, so `runCommand` prints `pnpm dev failed: <class> 28P01`. Every other error is retried as before. On timeout it throws new `PostgresNotReadyError` (in `main/dev.ts`, `reason = "postgres_not_ready"`, message "Postgres didn't become ready within 60 s"); `describeFailure` (F-26) reads `reason` from it as it does for `ResetRefusedError`, so the line is `pnpm dev failed: PostgresNotReadyError (postgres_not_ready)`. | F-22, F-26, TP-2.39 | none | planner decision |
| A-98 | M-3 (S-2 QA): `db:seed` with no seeders exits 0 without contacting the database, even when it's down. | **Accepted, no change.** With no seeders, seeding has nothing to do, so success is the right answer; checking reachability would only fail on a database `db:seed` doesn't need.

| A-100 | TP-3.4 uses `BudmonError` (F-50), which belongs to S-4 (test-architect, S-3). | **S-3 delivers F-50** (`platform/errors/BudmonError.ts`, the class only, exactly as specified); its test TP-4.18 moves to S-3 with it. F-51's platform errors, F-52's interceptor and everything else in S-4 stay in S-4. F-50 has no dependencies, so moving it adds no risk. | F-50, S-3, S-4, TP-4.18 | none | planner decision |
| A-101 | TP-3.5 expects `exception.values[0].value = CANARIES.message` replaced by the `type`, but `"CANARYMESSAGE7f3a"` passes F-30's `token` rule, so F-35 as written keeps it (test-architect, S-3). | **F-35 tightens; TP-3.5 stays.** A real message can be token-shaped (a payee, a code, a merchant name), so the `token` rule isn't a safe filter for exception text. `scrubSentryEvent` replaces **every** `exception.values[].value` by that entry's `type`, except a value matching the API error-key format `^[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]{1,63}$` (F-50's key rule; what F-34 and Android's F-260 put there for `BudmonError`s).

| A-102 | §10.1's project table doesn't list `apps/server/test/privacy/**` under `server-int` or `packages/test-support/test/**` under `tools`; the test-architect added both and the `@budmon/test-support` package (test-architect, S-3). | **Confirmed in place.** `server-int` includes `apps/server/test/integration/**/*.test.ts` and `apps/server/test/privacy/**/*.test.ts` (the canary suite needs the database); `tools` includes `packages/test-support/test/**/*.test.ts`. §2.2 already lists `packages/test-support/` (`@budmon/test-support`, test-architect's, S-3); it is a `devDependency` (`workspace:*`) of the root and of `@budmon/server`, never a runtime dependency (F-24 never bundles it). §2.4 pins the test dependencies `@opentelemetry/sdk-trace-base` 2.11.0 and `@opentelemetry/sdk-metrics` 2.11.0 (in-memory exporters and readers for `inMemoryTelemetry()`). | §2.2, §2.4, §10.1 | none | planner decision |
| A-103 | F-35 doesn't say whether a kept breadcrumb keeps its `category` (test-architect, S-3). | **Kept.** A kept breadcrumb has exactly `category` (`"http"` or `"navigation"`), `timestamp`, `type`, `level`, and `data.{url, method, status_code}` (each only when present), with `data.url` reduced as F-37 says. | F-35, TP-3.5 | none | planner decision |
| A-104 | Sentry 11 removed `sendDefaultPii` and `skipOpenTelemetrySetup` (software-engineer, S-3). | F-34's `Sentry.init` names the Sentry 11 options exactly: `dataCollection` with every collection flag off (no PII, request data, cookies, headers, IP, user agents, bodies or local variables), and `enableOpenTelemetrySetup: false` (F-36 owns the OpenTelemetry SDK; Sentry must not install its own). The rest of F-34 is unchanged. Pin `@sentry/node` 11.4.0 (§2.4, unchanged). | F-34 | none | planner decision |
| A-105 | F-38 needs a `FastifyInstance`, which arrives in S-4; the engineer typed it structurally and no S-3 test covers it (software-engineer, S-3). | **Recorded:** `export interface RequestLogHost { addHook(name: "onResponse", hook: (request: RequestLogRequest, reply: { statusCode: number; elapsedTime: number }) => Promise<void> \| void): unknown }`, with `RequestLogRequest` carrying the fields F-38 reads (`method`, `routeOptions.url`, `orpcRoute?`, and the request context); `registerRequestLog(app: RequestLogHost, deps)`. A `FastifyInstance` satisfies it. **Its test moves to S-4:** TP-4.17 (already S-4, through a real server) covers it; F-38 is delivered in S-3 and wired in S-4. | F-38, S-3, S-4 | none | planner decision |
| A-106 | F-36: the NodeSDK takes nothing from the environment, so `OTEL_*` variables can't make it export; with no endpoint and no injected reader there's no MeterProvider and instruments are no-ops (software-engineer, S-3). | **Confirmed as intended**, superseding F-36's "providers are created without exporters": configuration comes only from F-10 (`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` → `endpoint`); the SDK is built with `resourceDetectors: []`, no environment-derived exporters or readers, so no other `OTEL_*` variable has any effect. Without an endpoint and without an injected `traceExporter`/`metricReader`, no MeterProvider is registered and instruments are the API's no-ops; nothing leaves the process (stage 0 has no metrics backend).

| A-107 | Is pg-boss tracing S-6's? (software-engineer, S-3) | **Yes.** F-36's "pg-boss's built-in tracing is enabled" is delivered with F-77 in S-6, which creates the pg-boss instances; S-3 installs no pg-boss instrumentation. | F-36, S-6 | none | planner decision |

Upgrading any of them moves the whole OpenTelemetry set together. | §2.4, A-102 | none | planner decision |
| A-109 | `migrate` and `db:reset` now log to stderr, so stdout carries only migrate's report; check against F-92 (software-engineer, S-3). | **Confirmed, as a rule:** `createLogger` gains `stream?: "stdout" \| "stderr"` (default `"stdout"`; an injected `destination` still wins). Long-running processes (`api`, `worker`) log to stdout (container logs). Commands whose stdout is their output log to **stderr**: `migrate` (F-92's one-line report), `cli` (F-93's JSON and the bootstrap link, from S-6) and the development `db:*` commands. F-92 step 4 is consistent: its stdout holds exactly the report line. | F-31, F-92, F-93, TP-2.37 | none | planner decision |
| A-110 | G-1 (S-3 code review, privacy): V8's `err.stack` starts with `String(err)`, so a message line beginning with `    at ` passes F-33's frame filter; canaries leaked through `frames` into logs and the memory reporter, and through Sentry's own stack parser (whose `function`/`filename` F-35 keeps) on uncaught and unhandled errors. | **(1) Frames come only after the header.** F-33 computes `header = String(err)` (a throwing `toString` → no frames); if `err.stack` doesn't start with `header + "\n"`, `frames` is `[]` (a replaced or custom stack can't be split safely). Only the lines after the header are considered. **(2) Frames are rebuilt, not copied.** Each remaining line must match V8's frame grammar (`at <fn> (<location>)` or `at <location>`, location `<file>:<line>:<col>`); it's kept only if `function` matches `^(?:(?:async|new) )?[A-Za-z_$][A-Za-z0-9_$.<>\[\]]{0,99}$` (or is absent) and `filename`, after reduction, matches `^[A-Za-z0-9_@./<>:-]{1,200}$`. **Reduction:** strip `file://`; a path containing `/node_modules/` keeps the part from `node_modules/`; a path under the repository or image root (`join(serverRoot(), "../..")`) keeps the root-relative part; `node:` builtins keep `node:<name>`; anything else (other absolute paths, `eval` and `new Function` locations, URLs) becomes `<unknown>`. A line failing the grammar or the patterns is dropped. `frames` holds `at <function> (<filename>:<line>:<col>)` strings built from these parts. **(3) One event builder:** F-33 gains `export function buildErrorEvent(err: unknown): { type: string; value: string; stacktrace: { frames: { function?: string; filename: string; lineno: number; colno: number }[] } }` (`type` = `class`, `value` = `key ?? code ?? class`, frames from (2), innermost last as Sentry expects); F-34's `report` uses it. **(4) Sentry-native events:** F-34's `beforeSend(event, hint)` replaces `event.exception.values` with `[buildErrorEvent(hint.originalException)]` when `hint.originalException` is present; otherwise each value keeps only `type` (no `value`, no `stacktrace`). F-35 then re-checks every remaining frame against (2)'s patterns and drops failures. | F-33, F-34, F-35, TP-3.5, TP-3.13 (new), TP-3.14 (new) | none | planner decision |
| A-111 | G-2 (S-3 code review): F-41's `token` rule turns every `http_route` label into `"invalid"`, and F-38's `"unmatched"` fails F-30's route rule, so every request counts as an unexpected drop (DV-1). | **Per-label value rule in F-41:** `http_route` values must match F-30's `route` rule (`^/[A-Za-z0-9_./:{}-]{0,200}$`); every other label keeps the `token` rule. F-38's value for a request with no matched route is **`/unmatched`**, which passes both. A real route template therefore produces no drop. | F-38, F-41, TP-3.15 (new) | none | planner decision |
| A-112 | G-3 (S-3 code review): F-34 copies `ctx.route`, `jobName`, `errorKey` and `userId` into Sentry tags and `user.id` unvalidated; a `route` with `?token=` and a `userId` holding an email reached Sentry. | F-34's `report` validates each `ErrorContext` value with F-30's rules before use: `route` → `stripQuery` (F-37), then the `route` rule; `jobName` → `token`; `errorKey` → `errorKey`; `userId` and `requestId` → `id`. A failing value is **dropped** (not replaced). F-35 applies the same rules to `tags.route`, `tags.job`, `tags.error_key`, `tags.client_kind` (`token`) and `user.id`, dropping failures, so Sentry-native events are covered too. | F-34, F-35, TP-3.5, TP-3.6 | none | planner decision |
| A-113 | N-1: logger fields can override the fixed keys `event`, `service`, `release`. | **Fixed keys win.** F-31 writes the fixed keys (`level`, `time`, `service`, `release`, `event`) after the sanitised fields; a field with one of those names is dropped and counted. | F-31, TP-3.16 (new) | none | planner decision |
| A-114 | N-2: `AllowlistSpanExporter` keeps span `links` with their attributes. | F-40 keeps each link's `context` (trace and span ids) and drops its `attributes`; each dropped link attribute counts as `unexpected` unless its key is in `EXPECTED_DROPPED_SPAN_ATTRIBUTES`. | F-40, TP-3.16 | none | planner decision |
| A-115 | N-3: the start-up-failure logger in `api.ts`/`worker.ts` takes `release` from raw `BUDMON_RELEASE`. | F-90/F-91's fallback logger (used before `loadConfig` succeeds) uses `BUDMON_RELEASE` only if it matches F-10's release pattern, else `"dev"`. | F-90, F-91, TP-3.16 | none | planner decision |
| A-116 | N-4: by A-101's reasoning, free-text `token` fields (`reason`, `outcome`, `module`) could carry a token-shaped payee name. | **Rule, stated in F-30:** values of `token`-kind fields must be code constants (string literal unions, enum values, registered job or queue names), never derived from user data or external text; the rule checks only the shape.

| A-117 | B-3 (S-3 code review): F-198 finds base64 canaries only at one byte alignment. | F-198 searches, for each canary and each alignment `k` ∈ {0, 1, 2}, the **stable core** of `base64(k filler bytes + canary)`: the characters determined only by the canary's bytes (drop the leading characters that depend on the filler, the trailing ones that depend on following bytes, and padding), in both the standard and URL-safe alphabets. A canary therefore matches wherever it sits in an encoded payload. | F-198, TP-16.1 | none | planner decision |
| A-118 | Sentry's unhandled-rejection integration runs in its default `warn` mode and prints the raw error and stack (`Error: CANARYMESSAGE7f3a`) to stderr, bypassing F-31/F-33 (coordinator, S-3 review). | **F-34:** `onUnhandledRejectionIntegration({ mode: "none" })` (captures, prints nothing, doesn't exit) and `onUncaughtExceptionIntegration({ exitEvenIfOtherHandlersAreRegistered: false })` (captures, leaves exiting to our handler). Both events reach Sentry through `beforeSend`'s rebuild (A-110). **F-90/F-91 process handlers**, registered at start-up whether or not a DSN is set: `process.on("unhandledRejection", e => fatal("unhandled_rejection", e))` and `process.on("uncaughtException", e => fatal("uncaught_exception", e))`, where `fatal` logs `error(event, describeFailure(e), e)` through F-31 (so only F-33's sanitised form is written), awaits `reporter.flush(2000)`, and exits with code 1 (the container restarts the process). Nothing else writes the raw error anywhere. | F-34, F-90, F-91, TP-3.17 (new) | none | planner decision |
| A-119 | A-110's `function` pattern allows spaces (meant for `async fn` and `new Foo`), so the fixture frame `function: "x CANARYPAYEE7f3a y"` is kept, failing TP-3.5 (coordinator, S-3). | **(a) Tighten the rule** (defence in depth: F-35's re-check must catch text the header rule might miss): `function` must match `^(?:(?:async|new) )?[A-Za-z_$][A-Za-z0-9_$.<>\[\]]{0,99}$`, so a space is allowed only after a leading `async ` or `new `. V8 names such as `Object.<anonymous>`, `Foo.bar`, `async run` and `new Client` pass; anything else with a space (or parentheses, like `Promise.all (index 0)`) fails and the frame is dropped. The fixture stays. **Also recorded:** filename reduction is idempotent: an already-reduced name (`node_modules/x.js`, a repository-relative path, `node:<name>`, `<unknown>`) is returned unchanged, so F-35's re-check of `buildErrorEvent` output never alters it. | F-33, F-35, A-110, TP-3.5, TP-3.13 | none | planner decision |
| A-120 | TP-3.17 and TP-3.16's A-115 part can't be written: the LLD names no function for the fatal handlers or the fallback logger; the engineer built `installFatalHandlers` and `startupState` in `platform/observability/fatal.ts` (test-architect, S-3). | **Recorded as new F-39** with these exact signatures: `export interface FatalState { logger: Logger; reporter: ErrorReporter }`; `export function startupState(service: string, env: Readonly<Record<string, string \| undefined>>, opts?: { destination?: import("pino").DestinationStream }): FatalState` (logger with `release` = `BUDMON_RELEASE` if it matches F-10's release pattern, else `"dev"`; a no-op reporter); `export function installFatalHandlers(state: FatalState, exit?: (code: number) => void, target?: Pick<NodeJS.EventEmitter, "on">): void` (defaults `process.exit` and `process`; on `unhandledRejection`/`uncaughtException` it logs `error("unhandled_rejection" \| "uncaught_exception", describeFailure(e), e)` through `state.logger`, awaits `state.reporter.flush(2000)` (a throwing flush is ignored), then calls `exit(1)`). `state` is mutable: F-90/F-91 call both first, then replace `state.logger` and `state.reporter` with the configured ones once `loadConfig` succeeds. The `opts` and `target` parameters are additions for tests. **Tests:** TP-3.16 calls `startupState` with a `logCapture` destination; TP-3.17 (a) unit-tests `installFatalHandlers` with an `EventEmitter` target, a fake `exit` and a recording logger and reporter, and (b) spawns child processes (`tsx` running `apps/server/test/fixtures/fatalChild.ts`, the test-architect's) that call `startupState`, `installFatalHandlers` and optionally set `state.reporter = initSentry({ dsn })` with a DSN pointing at an in-test HTTP server collecting envelopes, then trigger the event; the test reads the child's stdout, stderr, exit code and the collected envelopes. | F-39 (new), F-31, F-90, F-91, TP-3.16, TP-3.17 | none | planner decision |
| A-121 | Token-shaped canaries pass A-112's rules (`CANARIES.token` as `userId` passes the `id` rule; `CANARIES.payee` as `jobName` passes `token`), so they reach Sentry (test-architect, S-3). | **Tightened**, by the reasoning of A-101 and A-116, to formats real values have and free text doesn't: `userId` must pass F-311 `isUuid`; `requestId` must match `^[0-9a-f]{32}$` (the request id format of §4.0); `jobName` must match F-70's job-name format `^[a-z][a-z0-9-]*\.[a-z][a-z0-9-]*$` (the reporter has no job registry, and the format already rejects the canaries); `errorKey` keeps `^[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]{1,63}$` and `route` the route rule after `stripQuery`; those two are code constants (A-116: error keys and route templates come from code), so an all-caps or path-shaped value from user data is out of contract and is caught by review and the canary suite. A failing value is dropped, in F-34 and again in F-35 (`user.id`, `tags.job`). | F-34, F-35, A-112, TP-3.6, TP-3.14 | none | planner decision |
| A-122 | TP-3.6 expects the request id "present" in the Sentry event, but F-34 has no field for it (coordinator, S-3). | **F-34 sends it** as the tag `request_id` when `ctx.requestId` passes A-121's rule (`^[0-9a-f]{32}$`), so a Sentry issue can be matched with the logs and with the reference users see on error screens (HLD J-3). F-35's tag allowlist becomes `route`, `job`, `client_kind`, `error_key`, `request_id`; `request_id` is dropped unless it matches the same rule. | F-34, F-35, TP-3.6 | none | planner decision |
| A-123 | Q-1 (test-architect, S-4): TP-4.8 and TP-4.16 need authed and owner procedures in a test contract, but F-53 exports only bases bound to the application contract. | F-53 (`platform/http/procedures.ts`) also exports the middlewares and a factory: `export const requireAuth` (oRPC middleware on `RequestContext`: `principal` null → `UnauthenticatedError`, else continues with `principal: Principal` non-null in context) and `export const requireOwner` (after `requireAuth`; `!principal.isOwner` → `ForbiddenError`); `export function procedureBases<C extends AnyContractRouter>(contract: C): { base; publicProcedure; authedProcedure; ownerProcedure }`, which returns `implement(contract).$context<RequestContext>()`, then `.use(requireAuth)` and `.use(requireAuth).use(requireOwner)`. The existing exports are `procedureBases(contract)`'s results for F-346's `contract` (`base`, `publicProcedure`, `authedProcedure`, `ownerProcedure`); `PUBLIC_PROCEDURES` is unchanged.

| A-125 | Q-3 (test-architect, S-4): `registerHealthRoutes(app, deps)` doesn't define `deps`, and `createApiServer` reads the journal from `drizzle/`, so TP-4.13 (c) calls `checkReadiness` directly. | `registerHealthRoutes(app: FastifyInstance, deps: { db: Database; appEnv: AppEnv; journal: readonly { hash: string; when: number }[]; timeoutMs?: number }): void`, the same inputs as `checkReadiness`. `createApiServer`'s `opts` gains `journal?: readonly { hash: string; when: number }[]` (default `readJournal(join(serverRoot(), "drizzle"))`, F-18, F-25), so TP-4.13 (c) runs over HTTP with an injected journal. Calling `checkReadiness` directly stays acceptable for its unit cases. | F-55, F-57, TP-4.13 | none | planner decision |
| A-126 | Q-4 (test-architect, S-4): TP-4.20 needs `test.hello` in the shipped `en.json`. | **No test messages in the product catalogue.** F-160 gains `export function createMessageRenderer(catalogs: Readonly<Record<string, Readonly<Record<string, string>>>>): (locale: string, id: string, values?: Record<string, string \| number>) => string` (keys are locale tags; `en` is required, else `TypeError`); `renderMessage` is `createMessageRenderer(<the shipped catalogs>)`.

| A-127 | Q-5 (test-architect, S-4): F-349's `prefix?` has no stated meaning. | `prefix` (default `""`) is prepended, followed by `.`, to every dotted path, for listing a sub-router under its key: `listProcedures(contract.meta, "meta")` returns `meta.clientConfig`, the same as listing the whole contract. Methods and routes are unaffected. | F-349 | none | planner decision |
| A-128 | Q-6 (test-architect, S-4): TP-4.7 says `"1.0"`; the test asserts `API_VERSION`. | **Confirmed.** The expected header and `apiVersion` are `API_VERSION` (F-341, `"1." + API_MINOR`), which is `"1.0"` while `API_MINOR` is 0; asserting the constant keeps the test right after a bump. | TP-4.7 | none | planner decision |
| A-129 | The Kotlin spike's toolchain (TP-4.3) isn't pinned; §2.4 says "latest stable" (test-architect, S-4). | §2.4 records the spike's toolchain: Kotlin **2.2.20**, kotlinx-serialization **1.9.0**, with OkHttp 5.5.0 and Retrofit 3.0.0 (already listed). S-13 starts from these pins; moving to a newer Kotlin there is a reviewed change recorded in §2.4. | §2.4 | none | planner decision |
| A-130 | In production and rehearsal F-57's `checkReadiness` reads `drizzle.__drizzle_migrations` as `budmon_app` (the API's connection), which has no privilege on schema `drizzle`, so readiness would fail with 42501; TP-4.13 (c) worked around it by connecting as `budmon_migrator` (test-architect, S-4). | **Option (a), for `budmon_app` only.** The table holds only migration hashes and timestamps, so read access leaks nothing, and it avoids a `SECURITY DEFINER` function or a second connection. F-16 (schema step 4), **when schema `drizzle` exists** (it's created by F-18 in migrate mode; push-mode databases have none and readiness then skips the check, F-57 step 2): `GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA drizzle TO budmon_app` and `GRANT SELECT ON drizzle.__drizzle_migrations TO budmon_app`; nothing else on that schema, and nothing for `budmon_capture`, `budmon_queue` or `budmon_monitor` (only the API serves `/health/ready`; workers use the heartbeat, F-79). §3.3 records it. TP-4.13 (c) connects as **`budmon_app`**, like the real API. Also fixed in passing: §3.4's "Names are the English ISO names" now says CLDR English names (A-69). | F-16, §3.3, §3.4, F-57, TP-2.11, TP-4.13 | none | planner decision |
| A-131 | S-3 QA F-1: an invalid `SENTRY_DSN` makes Sentry print `Invalid Sentry Dsn: <whole DSN, key included>` to the console, outside F-31, and reporting silently stays off. | **F-10 validates the format:** `SENTRY_DSN` must match `^https://[A-Za-z0-9]{1,64}@[A-Za-z0-9.-]{1,253}(:\d{1,5})?/\d{1,20}$` (public key, host, optional port, numeric project id; no path, query, password or fragment); otherwise problem `SENTRY_DSN: invalid DSN` (value never echoed), exit 78. **`initSentry` checks the same pattern** and, on failure, returns the no-op reporter without calling `Sentry.init` (defence for callers that bypass F-10). **Sentry's console is silenced in general:** `debug: false`, and Sentry's internal logger is never enabled; F-34 never routes Sentry output to the console. | F-10, F-34, TP-2.42 (new), TP-3.18 (new) | none | planner decision |
| A-132 | S-3 QA F-2: a throwing getter on an error (e.g. `code`) makes `sanitizeError` and `reporter.report` throw, which can crash the process; F-33 says "Errors: none". | **Contract clarified:** F-33, F-26 `describeFailure`, `buildErrorEvent` and F-34's `report` read every property of the error inside `try`/`catch`. A property whose read throws counts as absent (a throwing `constructor` or `name` gives `class "NonError"`; a throwing `stack` gives `frames: []`). None of them ever throws. | F-26, F-33, F-34, TP-3.4 | none | planner decision |
| A-133 | S-3 QA F-3: a log call whose field has a throwing getter writes nothing and counts nothing. | F-30 `sanitizeFields` reads each field inside `try`/`catch`; a field whose read throws is **dropped and counted** in `dropped`, like an unknown key. F-31 then writes the line with the remaining fields. F-31 still never throws. | F-30, F-31, TP-3.2 | none | planner decision |
| A-134 | S-3 QA F-7: F-35 reads `event.breadcrumbs.values`, but Sentry 11 sends `event.breadcrumbs` as an array, so every breadcrumb is dropped. Are breadcrumbs wanted at all with `defaultIntegrations: false`? | **Real shape:** F-35 reads `event.breadcrumbs` as an array (and, defensively, `{ values: [] }`), passes each through `scrubBreadcrumb` (A-103's rules unchanged), and always writes an array. **Wanted?** On the server none are generated today: `defaultIntegrations: false` installs no HTTP or console integration, and Budmon code adds none. The rules stay as a guard for any future breadcrumb source; `maxBreadcrumbs` stays 20. | F-35, TP-3.5 | none | planner decision |
| A-135 | S-3 QA F-5: `db.query.text` is exported verbatim, so a query with inline literals leaks them; developer-set span names are exported as is. | **Mask, don't trust the convention.** F-40 rewrites `db.query.text` before export: single-quoted strings (including `E'…'` and doubled quotes), dollar-quoted strings (`$tag$…$tag$`) and numeric literals that aren't part of an identifier or a `$n` placeholder are each replaced by `?`. A text whose quoting can't be parsed (an unterminated quote) is dropped and counted `unexpected`. **Span names:** must match `^[A-Za-z0-9_.:/{}* -]{1,120}$` (`*` added by A-164), else the name becomes `"span"` and one `unexpected` drop is counted. Names created by Budmon code are code constants (A-116); the shape check is the backstop. | F-40, TP-3.7 | none | planner decision |
| A-136 | S-3 QA F-6: `route` and `http_route` accept `/accounts/<uuid>/Carrefour-Maadi`, so logging `request.url` instead of the template leaks ids and payees. | **A cheap rule for the common mistake, plus A-116 for the rest:** F-30's `route` rule (and so F-41's `http_route`) also rejects a value with a segment that is UUID-shaped (`[0-9a-fA-F]{8}-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}-…`) or contains a run of 5 or more digits. Templates use `{id}` or `:id`, so real templates pass. Free text in a segment can't be told from a template word, so route values remain code constants (A-116): the route template, never `request.url`. | F-30, F-41, TP-3.9 | none | planner decision |
| A-137 | S-3 QA, diagnosis: Sentry issues show only the class, so every Pg error is "DatabaseError" and ECONNREFUSED looks like ENOTFOUND. | **Add two tags, already safe by format:** `error_code` = F-33's `code` (a SQLSTATE `^[0-9A-Z]{5}$` or a Node code `^E[A-Z0-9_]{1,30}$`) and `http_status` = F-33's `status` (100..599). F-34 sets them; F-35's tag allowlist adds both with those rules (dropped otherwise). The exception `value` rule (A-101) is unchanged. | F-34, F-35, TP-3.5, TP-3.6 | none | planner decision |
| A-138 | S-3 QA F-8: `${endpoint}/v1/traces` breaks with a query string; there's no way to pass OTLP auth headers (Grafana Cloud needs them) because `OTEL_*` is ignored; a duplicate metric label doesn't throw. | **Endpoint:** F-10 requires `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` to be an `https://` URL (or `http://localhost:<port>` in development and test) with no query or fragment; F-36 builds `new URL("v1/traces", base)` and `new URL("v1/metrics", base)` where `base` is the endpoint with a trailing `/` added if missing. **Headers:** new secret `OTLP_HEADERS_FILE` (all kinds, optional): a JSON object of header names (`^[A-Za-z0-9-]{1,64}$`) to string values, read as `Config.otlpHeaders?: Secret<Record<string, string>>`, passed to both OTLP exporters; invalid → problem `OTLP_HEADERS_FILE: invalid`. Only used when the endpoint is set. Stage 1's LLD fills it for Grafana Cloud. **Metrics:** F-41 registration with a label listed twice throws `Error("metric definition invalid: <name>")`, like the other definition errors. | F-10, F-36, F-41, TP-2.42, TP-3.8, TP-3.11 | none | planner decision |
| A-139 | S-3 QA: `invalid_event` and `[invalid]` carry no hint of the call site or reason. | **In development and test only**, F-31 adds `droppedKeys`: the names of fields dropped or replaced on that line (only names matching `^[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9_]{0,63}$`; others are counted but not named). In `rehearsal` and `production` nothing is added, because a key can be derived from data. An invalid `event` is never echoed (it may be text). `createLogger` gains `appEnv` to decide; F-90/F-91 pass it once configuration is loaded. | F-31, TP-3.2 | none | planner decision |
| A-140 | S-3 QA F-4: the configuration-failure output doesn't name the process and isn't JSON. | **No change.** It's written before any logger exists, to a human at a console or in `docker logs`, where the container name already identifies the process; the plain `Configuration invalid:` list is the specified, tested form (F-11, TP-2.2, TP-2.6). | none | none | planner decision |
| A-141 | A-131's https-only DSN pattern makes `initSentry` refuse the test fake's `http://publickey@127.0.0.1:<port>/1`, failing 8 tests in `errorReporter.test.ts` (coordinator, S-4). | **Allow a local http DSN in development and test only**, in both F-10 and `initSentry` (which already receives `environment`): `^http://[A-Za-z0-9]{1,64}@(localhost\|127\.0\.0\.1):\d{1,5}/\d{1,20}$` is accepted when `APP_ENV` is `development` or `test`; in `rehearsal` and `production` only the https pattern is. An injectable transport was rejected because it would leave the real DSN parsing and transport path untested. TP-3.18's DSN (`https://pub:SECRETKEYabc@…/`, a password and no project id) stays refused, as does an http DSN with a password or path, or to another host. | F-10, F-34, TP-2.42, TP-3.18 | none | planner decision |
| A-142 | Engineer deviations while implementing A-131 to A-139 (software-engineer, S-4). | **Recorded as specified behaviour:** (1) F-36's `cfg` gains `headers?: Secret<Record<string, string>>` (from `config.otlpHeaders`, A-138), passed to both OTLP exporters. (2) F-40's masking (`maskQueryText`) also removes SQL comments (`-- …` to end of line and `/* … */`), since they can carry anything; an unterminated block comment drops the whole text (`unexpected`); double-quoted identifiers are kept. (3) The OTLP endpoint check also rejects URLs with credentials (`user:pass@`); problems are `must be an https URL` (wrong scheme or credentials) and `must not have a query or fragment`. (4) F-30 adds `export function sanitizeFieldsWithKeys(fields): { fields; dropped: number; droppedKeys: string[] }` (used by F-31 for A-139); `sanitizeFields` keeps its shape. | F-30, F-36, F-40, F-10, TP-3.7, TP-2.42 | none | planner decision |
| A-143 | S-4 implementation notes (software-engineer). | **Recorded:** (1) F-348's R1 and R3 apply to request bodies and **2xx** response bodies only; error responses are oRPC's generated envelopes, whose schemas are fixed by §5.1 and F-342. (2) `@orpc/server` is a dependency of `@budmon/contract` (peer of `@orpc/zod`). (3) `listProcedures` (F-349) is exported from the contract index (F-346). (4) The `contract` CI job's oasdiff action is pinned by commit SHA (A-17). (5) `UuidSchema` and `CursorSchema` are registered in oRPC's JSON-schema registry, so they appear as named components. (6) F-61 registers helmet with `useDefaults: false`, so only the headers F-61 lists are sent. | F-61, F-346, F-348, §10.1 | none | planner decision |
| A-144 | Fastify prints FSTDEP023 for `disableRequestLogging` (software-engineer, S-4). | **Remove the option.** With `logger: false` Fastify has no logger and logs no requests, so `disableRequestLogging` has no effect; F-38 does request logging. F-55 step 1 no longer sets it. | F-55 | none | planner decision |
| A-145 | Requests refused for body errors (F-62) are logged with route `/unmatched` (software-engineer, S-4). | **Confirmed.** F-62 answers before oRPC matches a procedure, so there's no route template; Fastify's own route is the `/api/v1/*` catch-all, which says nothing. `/unmatched` (A-111) is the honest value; status and `errorKey` distinguish these lines. | F-38, F-62 | none | planner decision |
| A-146 | A-80 covers a missing journal but not an existing one with no `entries`; the code then skips Drizzle's `migrate`, so schema `drizzle` and `__drizzle_migrations` never exist, which leaves A-130's grant and F-57's readiness undefined (coordinator, S-4). | **Uniform layout from the first deploy.** In migrate mode, F-18 always runs, before anything else, `CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS drizzle` and `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS drizzle.__drizzle_migrations (id serial PRIMARY KEY, hash text NOT NULL, created_at bigint)` (Drizzle's own definition, so its `migrate` later finds it unchanged), whether the journal is missing (A-80), empty or not; it then calls Drizzle's `migrate` only when the journal has entries. So every migrate-mode database has the table, F-16 step 5 (A-130) always grants `budmon_app` its `SELECT`, and F-57 compares against a real (possibly empty) table: an empty table and an empty journal are `ok`. **F-57 when the table is absent** (only push-mode databases, which never run in rehearsal or production): unchanged rule, ready if the journal is empty, `schema_behind` otherwise. | F-18, F-57, TP-2.11, TP-2.13, TP-4.13 | none | planner decision |
| A-147 | G-1 (S-4 code review, blocking): the production api exports no spans. `api.ts` statically imports Fastify, `pg` and `node:http` before `startTelemetry` runs, and the bundle loads them as ESM, which OpenTelemetry's CommonJS hooks never see; TP-4.21's import order differs from the real entry. | **Telemetry starts in a preload, before any application module loads.** New **F-89 `main/instrument.ts`** (bundled as `dist/main/instrument.js`; F-24 adds it to the entry points) runs through `node --import`: (1) `module.register("@opentelemetry/instrumentation/hook.mjs", import.meta.url)` (the ESM loader hook, import-in-the-middle; the instrumented packages stay external to the bundle, A-43, so the hook sees them); (2) the process kind from `basename(process.argv[1])`: `api` or `worker` (anything else, e.g. `migrate`, `cli`: return, no telemetry); (3) `loadConfig(kind, process.env, readFileSync)` inside `try`; a `ConfigError` returns silently and the entry reports it (exit 78); (4) `await import(<otel module>)`, then `startTelemetry(...)` with the configured endpoint, headers, service and release; (5) stores the handle at `globalThis[Symbol.for("budmon.telemetry")]`. Because `--import` modules finish evaluating before the entry's module graph is loaded, every instrumented module (`node:http`, `undici`, `pg`, `fastify`) loads after the instrumentations are registered, regardless of the entry's static imports. **F-90/F-91** no longer call `startTelemetry`; they read the handle with `getTelemetry()` (from F-89's module: the stored handle, or a no-op handle when absent) for metrics and shutdown. **Starting:** every api and worker start is `node --import ./dist/main/instrument.js dist/main/<api\|worker>.js`: the image's `CMD`/entry (S-15), the laptop Compose `command`s for `api`, `worker-general` and `worker-capture` (F-175), and TP-2.6's spawn; `migrate` and `cli` stay plain `node`. **Development:** F-22 starts `tsx watch --import ./apps/server/src/main/instrument.ts …`. **Tests:** TP-4.21 keeps its in-process check; new **TP-4.24** spawns the built api through the real start command against an OTLP recorder and asserts server spans; new **TP-6.15** does the same for the worker and asserts a `pg` span from a job (the first place the production bundle runs a query under a parent span). | F-24, F-36, F-89 (new), F-90, F-91, F-22, F-175, §2.3 (Dockerfile), TP-2.6, TP-4.24 (new), TP-6.15 (new) | none | planner decision |
| A-148 | G-2 (S-4 code review, blocking): oRPC's OpenAPI handler passes query values as strings, so `listInput`'s `limit: z.number()` refuses `?limit=5` with 400, and every R4 integer or boolean query parameter fails. | **oRPC's smart-coercion plugin**, registered on F-55's `OpenAPIHandler` (step 5) with the zod JSON-schema converter: `new SmartCoercionPlugin({ schemaConverters: [new ZodToJsonSchemaConverter()] })`. It coerces query and path strings to the type the schema declares (integer, boolean, date) before validation, so schemas stay `z.number().int()` and `z.boolean()`, the emitted OpenAPI keeps `type: integer`/`boolean` (R1, R4 hold), and the generated Kotlin client keeps `Int`/`Long`/`Boolean` parameters. `z.coerce` was rejected: its input type is `unknown`, which the converter emits as an untyped schema (R1 fails) and the Kotlin client would see as `Any`.

| A-149 | G-3 (S-4 code review): F-52 rule 4 maps every non-`INTERNAL` `ORPCError` to 404, including contract-defined errors thrown through the handler's typed `errors` (`errors.CONFLICT({ data })` → 404). | **Defined errors pass through.** New F-52 rule 1b, before rule 4: an `ORPCError` with `defined: true` (oRPC sets it only for errors declared in the contract, with data validated against their schema) is returned unchanged, with its own status and data, `report: false`. Rule 4 now covers only oRPC's built-in, undefined errors (unmatched route, unsupported method). Modules may throw either `BudmonError` or their contract's typed errors. | F-52, TP-4.9, TP-4.26 (new) | none | planner decision |
| A-150 | B-4 (S-4 code review): the engineer made `readJournal` treat a journal file without `entries` as empty, which on a first deploy fails open (no migrations applied, readiness ok, no tables). | **A malformed journal is an error.** A missing file or folder still means zero migrations (A-80). A file that exists must parse as JSON with an `entries` array, else `readJournal` throws new `JournalInvalidError` (message `drizzle journal is invalid`, no file content). `migrate` exits **5**; the api fails start-up (exit 1, `startup_failed` with `errorClass "JournalInvalidError"`). | F-18, F-92, §6, TP-2.13 | none | planner decision |
| A-151 | N-2: helmet still sends defaults beyond F-61's list (COOP, Origin-Agent-Cluster, X-DNS-Prefetch-Control, X-Download-Options, X-Frame-Options, X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies, X-XSS-Protection). | **Accepted and listed.** They harden API responses and cost nothing; Budmon's Google sign-in is a redirect flow, so COOP `same-origin` breaks nothing. F-61 lists them with helmet's values: `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin`, `Origin-Agent-Cluster: ?1`, `X-DNS-Prefetch-Control: off`, `X-Download-Options: noopen`, `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN`, `X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies: none`, `X-XSS-Protection: 0`. A-143 (6) is corrected: `useDefaults: false` doesn't remove these. | F-61, A-143, TP-5.1 | none | planner decision |
| A-152 | N-3: F-62's JSON parser is plain `JSON.parse`, dropping Fastify's prototype-poisoning protection. | **Use `secure-json-parse`** (`parse(text, null, { protoAction: "remove", constructorAction: "remove" })`), already a Fastify dependency; added as a direct dependency of `@budmon/server` at the version Fastify 5.12.5 uses. `__proto__` keys and `constructor.prototype` are removed before validation. | F-62, §2.4, TP-5.2 | none | planner decision |
| A-153 | N-4: `UuidSchema` accepts any 8-4-4-4-12 hex, including nil; A-41's `isUuid` requires version 1 to 8 and variant `[89ab]`. | **Aligned:** `UuidSchema = z.string().regex(<A-41's isUuid pattern>).meta({ format: "uuid" })`, so the OpenAPI schema keeps `format: uuid` (R4) and gains the pattern; nil, max, upper case and other versions are refused with `VALIDATION_FAILED`. | F-340, TP-4.27 (new) | none | planner decision |
| A-154 | N-5: the auth hook runs for `/health/*`, so a throwing hook turns liveness and readiness into 500. | **Authenticate only `/api/v1/*`.** F-55's `onRequest` hook calls `authHook.authenticate` only when the URL path starts with `/api/v1/`; other routes (`/health/*`, `/dev/objects/*`) get `principal: null`. Module routes under `/api/v1/` (A-26) are authenticated as before. | F-55, TP-4.13 | none | planner decision |
| A-155 | `getTelemetry()` lives where? Importing `instrument.ts` runs its start-up code (software-engineer, S-4). | **Confirmed:** `getTelemetry()` and `TelemetryHandle` live in `platform/observability/telemetryHandle.ts` (no side effects); `instrument.ts` stores the handle through it and re-exports both. Entry points and tests import from `telemetryHandle.ts`, never from `instrument.ts`. | F-89, F-90, F-91 | none | planner decision |
| A-156 | The preload's `onDrop` needs somewhere to count (software-engineer, S-4). | **Confirmed:** right after `startTelemetry`, F-89 creates F-42's `telemetry_attributes_dropped_total` counter on the global meter and passes `onDrop` to F-40 and F-41 through it, so drops are counted from the first span. F-90/F-91 don't create it again. | F-89, F-42 | none | planner decision |
| A-157 | Worker service name in the preload (software-engineer, S-4). | **Confirmed:** the preload uses `worker-<role>` when `WORKER_ROLES` has one role and `worker` otherwise (development), matching F-91's service names. Until S-6, `worker.ts`'s logger and Sentry still say `"worker"`; S-6 switches them to the same rule. | F-89, F-91, S-6 | none | planner decision |
| A-158 | The worker calls `getTelemetry().shutdown()` right after validating its configuration, since it does nothing yet (software-engineer, S-4). | **Confirmed as interim:** until S-6 the worker validates configuration, shuts telemetry down and exits 0. From S-6 shutdown happens in F-91's `SIGTERM` path after `stop()`, like the api. | F-91, S-6 | none | planner decision |
| A-159 | `module.register` is deprecated in Node's types and needs a lint suppression; `registerHooks` doesn't accept asynchronous loader hooks (software-engineer, S-4). | **Confirmed:** F-89 keeps `module.register` (OpenTelemetry's `hook.mjs` is an asynchronous loader hook), with one `eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-deprecated -- <reason>` line. Revisit when OpenTelemetry ships a synchronous hook for `registerHooks`. | F-89 | none | planner decision |
| A-160 | A journal with a valid `entries` array but badly shaped entries isn't covered by A-150, and fails later with exit 1 (software-engineer, S-4). | **`JournalInvalidError` covers it.** `readJournal` validates every entry: `tag` a string matching `^[0-9]{4}_[a-z0-9_]+$`, `when` a non-negative safe integer, `idx` an integer equal to its position; and `<tag>.sql` must exist in the folder. Any failure throws `JournalInvalidError` (no file content in the message), so `migrate` exits 5 before touching the database. | F-18, TP-2.13 | none | planner decision |
| A-161 | F-90 says `api_started` logs `{ release, service: "api" }`, but A-113 (fixed keys win) means those fields are dropped (software-engineer, S-4). | **Text corrected:** F-90 logs `info("api_started")` with no fields; `service` and `release` appear as the logger's fixed keys. F-91's `worker_started` the same. | F-90, F-91 | none | planner decision |
| A-162 | After A-160 the code validates the journal earlier than the LLD says: `runMigrate` before connecting, and F-18 before A-146's `CREATE SCHEMA`/`CREATE TABLE` (coordinator, `aee9e69`). | **Confirmed; the LLD follows the code.** A damaged journal must stop the run before the database is touched. **F-92 (`runMigrate`):** after the configuration check and before connecting, `readJournal(join(serverRoot(), "drizzle"))`; `JournalInvalidError` → exit 5 with nothing changed (the roles step, F-15, never runs). **F-18:** reads and validates the journal first, then runs A-146's two `IF NOT EXISTS` statements, then Drizzle's `migrate` when there are entries; A-146's "always first" now means "before any migration work, after validation". F-11 (configuration) is unchanged. | F-18, F-92, A-146 | none | planner decision |
| A-163 | TP-4.24 expects an `@fastify/otel` SERVER span, which can't happen: `@fastify/otel` 0.21.1 makes its `request` span INTERNAL when `instrumentation-http` has opened the SERVER span (deliberately, against double counting); without `registerOnInitialization: true` it made no spans at all (software-engineer, `487b6b7`). | **F-36** registers `new FastifyOtelInstrumentation({ registerOnInitialization: true })`. The expected trace for one API request is: the http instrumentation's **SERVER** span, and under it `@fastify/otel`'s **INTERNAL** spans (`request`, and one per lifecycle hook and the route handler). **TP-4.24 asserts:** one SERVER span from scope `@opentelemetry/instrumentation-http` for the request; at least one span from scope `@fastify/otel` named `request`, with that SERVER span as an ancestor; and no `unexpected` drops (A-164). | F-36, TP-4.24 | none | planner decision |
| A-164 | Fastify spans reach the recorder named `"span"`: their names fail A-135's span-name rule, and every request would count `unexpected` drops (software-engineer, S-4). | **Checked against the sources.** `instrumentation-http` 0.222.0 renames the SERVER span to `<METHOD> <http.route>` once `@fastify/otel` sets `http.route` to Fastify's `routeOptions.url`, which for oRPC is the catch-all `/api/v1/*`, so the name `GET /api/v1/*` fails only on `*`. `@fastify/otel` 0.21.1 names hook spans `` `${hookName} - ${handlerName}` ``, where `handlerName` is the handler function's name or, for anonymous handlers, the plugin name (e.g. `fastify -> @fastify/helmet`), which contains `>` and `@`. Both come from code, not requests, but plugin names have no bounded alphabet. **Decision:** (1) the span-name rule becomes `^[A-Za-z0-9_.:/{}* -]{1,120}$` (adds `*`, which carries no data); (2) for spans from instrumentation scope `@fastify/otel`, F-40 names the span by the part before the first ` - ` (the hook name: `onRequest`, `preHandler`, `handler`, `notFoundHandler`, …) before applying the rule, and counts nothing (an expected, deterministic rewrite); `request` is unchanged. Any other span failing the rule is still renamed `span` and counted `unexpected`. Widening the rule to plugin-name characters was rejected (unbounded); counting them `expected` was rejected (it would hide a real leak of the same shape). | F-40, A-135, TP-3.7, TP-4.24 | none | planner decision |
| A-165 | G-1 (S-4 re-review): A-148's `SmartCoercionPlugin` coerces the whole input, JSON bodies included, so `{"amountMinor":" 100 ","flag":"ON"}` becomes `100` and `true`. | **Coerce only where values arrive as strings.** The coercion step (oRPC's `JsonSchemaCoercer` with the zod converter, run by a Budmon interceptor on the OpenAPI handler instead of the plugin) applies only to requests whose method is `GET`, `HEAD` or `DELETE`, which carry no body (R4), so only their query and path values are coerced. Requests with a body are never coerced: JSON bodies must carry real numbers and booleans, so a string amount or `"ON"` fails with `VALIDATION_FAILED`. To keep path values safe on body-carrying operations without coercion, **R4 gains:** on an operation with a request body, every path parameter is a string schema (`format: uuid`, `enum` or a date pattern). | F-55, F-348 (R4), TP-4.5, TP-4.25 | none | planner decision |
| A-166 | G-2 (S-4 re-review): oRPC marks any thrown `ORPCError` whose code and status match a declared error *without a data schema* as `defined: true`, keeping its message and data; F-342 declares `UNAUTHENTICATED`, `FORBIDDEN`, `NOT_FOUND`, `IDEMPOTENCY_KEY_REUSED` and `PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE` without data, so rule 1b can leak a thrown message and data; a defined `INTERNAL` or `SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE` is never reported; a module's `BAD_REQUEST` without data would expose raw zod issues ahead of rule 2. | **Rule 1b becomes rule 3b**, after rules 2 and 3 (input and output validation keep their mapping, so raw zod issues never pass). For an `ORPCError` with `defined: true`: (a) the **message** is the declared one (§6's fixed message for platform keys; the contract's declared `message` for module keys, else the key), never the thrown one; (b) **data** is kept only when the declared error has a data schema (oRPC has validated it), otherwise dropped; (c) `INTERNAL` and `SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE` are **excluded**: they fall through to rules 5 and 6 (`data: { outcome }`, reported); (d) `report: false` otherwise. | F-52, TP-4.9, TP-4.26 | none | planner decision |
| A-167 | G-3 (S-4 re-review): §2.4 lacks `@orpc/json-schema` and `@opentelemetry/instrumentation`. | §2.4 adds `@orpc/json-schema` 1.15.4 (with the other oRPC packages) and `@opentelemetry/instrumentation` 0.222.0 (with the OpenTelemetry set, A-108). | §2.4 | none | planner decision |
| A-168 | N-1 (S-4 re-review): A-154's guard and the `onSend` version header check the raw `request.url`; `/%61pi/v1/x` reaches the catch-all while `startsWith("/api/v1/")` is false (fails closed). | **Key both on the matched route:** authentication runs, and `X-Budmon-API-Version` is set, when `request.routeOptions.url` starts with `/api/v1/` (the oRPC catch-all `/api/v1/*` and module routes under it, A-26). Unmatched requests (Fastify's 404) are neither authenticated nor versioned. Percent-encoded paths then get the same treatment as their decoded match. | F-55, TP-4.13 | none | planner decision |
| A-169 | N-2 (S-4 re-review): F-340 says `.meta({ format: "uuid" })` but the code uses `JSON_SCHEMA_REGISTRY.add`; contract's `UUID_PATTERN` copies `isUuid`'s regex because `@budmon/contract` doesn't depend on `@budmon/shared`. | **Text aligned:** `UuidSchema` is `z.string().regex(UUID_PATTERN)` registered with `JSON_SCHEMA_REGISTRY.add(UuidSchema, { format: "uuid", pattern: UUID_PATTERN.source })`. **Drift test added:** TP-4.28 asserts `UUID_PATTERN.source` and `flags` equal the regex behind F-311 `isUuid` (exported from `packages/shared/src/ids/ids.ts` as `UUID_PATTERN` for this purpose). The copy stays; adding a runtime dependency for one regex was rejected. | F-311, F-340, TP-4.28 (new) | none | planner decision |
| A-170 | `mapError` gained an optional third parameter `declared` (the procedure's error map, `procedure["~orpc"].errorMap`), passed through the interceptor's new optional `errorMap` (software-engineer, `f9c06cc`). | **Confirmed.** `mapError(err, state, declared?: Readonly<Record<string, { message?: string; data?: unknown } \| undefined>>)`. Rule 3b uses it: platform keys always take §6's message from `PLATFORM_ERRORS`; a module key takes `declared[key].message` (else the key) and keeps data only when `declared[key].data` (a schema) exists. Called with two arguments, a module key gets the key as message and no data (the safe default). `createErrorInterceptor`'s per-call options gain `errorMap?`, which F-55 fills from the matched procedure. | F-52 | none | planner decision |
| A-171 | `RequestContext` gained an optional `method`: oRPC interceptors don't see the HTTP request, and A-165's coercion needs the method (software-engineer, `f9c06cc`). | **Confirmed.** `RequestContext.method?: string` (upper-case HTTP method), set by F-55's `onRequest` for every request; optional only so contexts built in tests compile. The coercion interceptor coerces only when `method` is `GET` (A-173, A-175); an absent `method` means **no coercion** (fails safe). | §4.0 (`RequestContext`), F-55, TP-4.25 | none | planner decision |
| A-172 | A-166 sends a defined `SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE` to rules 5 and 6, but rule 5 matches only SQLSTATE and Node codes, so it ends as `INTERNAL` 500 (software-engineer, `f9c06cc`). | **Not intended. New rule 5b:** a defined `SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE` → `SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE` 503 with §6's message and `data: { outcome }` (computed from the commit tracker; thrown data ignored), `report: true`. A defined `INTERNAL` still goes to rule 6 (500, `{ outcome }`, reported). | F-52, TP-4.9 | none | planner decision |
| A-173 | oRPC 1.15.4's compact input reads the query string only for `GET`; a `DELETE`'s input is its path parameters plus its body, so `DELETE ?force=true` never reaches the handler, and the generator would put non-path `DELETE` fields into a `requestBody` (test-architect, `f369019`). | **`DELETE` takes path parameters only.** R4 adds: a `DELETE` operation has no query parameters and no request body, and its path parameters are string schemas (`format: uuid`, `enum` or a date pattern). Options needed by a delete (for example "force") become a `POST` action route (`POST /things/{id}/delete`) or a separate resource. A detailed input structure was rejected: it splits every procedure's input shape into `params`/`query`/`body` for one rare case. **Coercion** (A-165) applies to `GET` and `HEAD` only; the path-parameter rule becomes "on every operation other than `GET` and `HEAD`, path parameters are string schemas", since nothing coerces them. | F-55, F-348 (R4), A-165, TP-4.5, TP-4.25 | none | planner decision |
| A-174 | TP-4.9's A-170 example declares `CONFLICT` with a custom message, but `CONFLICT` is a platform key, whose message is always §6's (test-architect). | **Row corrected:** the declared-message case uses the module key `PAYEE_EXISTS` (`{ PAYEE_EXISTS: { message: "Already exists", data: <schema> } }`), as the code and tests do; a platform key with a declared message keeps §6's. | TP-4.9 | none | planner decision |
| A-175 | `HEAD` never reaches a procedure: Fastify routes it to the `/api/v1/*` catch-all, but oRPC 1.15.4 matches by method and has no `HEAD` handling, so `HEAD /api/v1/t/list?limit=5` gets the 404 envelope (software-engineer, `d89a125`). | **Option (b): `HEAD` isn't supported on `/api/v1`.** No Budmon client sends it (the generated Kotlin client and the web client only call the operations in the OpenAPI document, which lists none), and mapping it to `GET` would run procedures, auth and database work for a request that discards the body. A `HEAD` to `/api/v1/*` is answered like any unsupported method, by F-52 rule 4: **404** with the `NOT_FOUND` envelope's headers (Fastify sends no body for `HEAD`), not 405, matching `OPTIONS` (D-36). The A-168 hooks still apply (the matched route is `/api/v1/*`, so authentication runs and `X-Budmon-API-Version` is set), and the http SERVER span is named `HEAD /api/v1/*` (A-164's rule allows it). **Coercion** applies to `GET` only, and R4's path rule becomes "on every operation other than `GET`, path parameters are string schemas". `/health/*` keeps Fastify's automatic `HEAD` (no oRPC involved). | F-52, F-55, F-348 (R4), A-165, A-173, TP-4.25 | none | planner decision |
| A-176 | D-1 (S-4 QA, privacy): F-40 allowlists `url.path` and only strips the query, so the SERVER span carries the client's full path (`/api/v1/CANARYPAYEE7f3a/987654321/canary.7f3a@example.invalid`), including path parameters on matched routes; `http.route` is only the catch-all `/api/v1/*`. | **No raw path in traces.** `url.path` is removed from F-40's allowlist (and added to `EXPECTED_DROPPED_SPAN_ATTRIBUTES`, so the drop is `expected`); this covers SERVER, CLIENT and `@fastify/otel` spans alike. **Route instead:** an oRPC interceptor in F-55 sets the attribute `budmon.route` on the active span to the matched procedure's OpenAPI path template (`/payees/{id}`, the same value F-38 logs); a request that matches no procedure gets no `budmon.route` (the span keeps `http.route = /api/v1/*`). `budmon.route` is allowlisted and must pass F-30's `route` rule (A-136), else it's dropped (`unexpected`). | F-40, F-55, TP-3.7, TP-4.24 | none | planner decision |
| A-177 | D-2 (S-4 QA, privacy): the client's `Host` and `X-Forwarded-Host` become `server.address` and `server.port` on SERVER spans (`Host: CANARYPAYEE7f3a.example.invalid:987654321`). | **Dropped for SERVER spans, kept for CLIENT spans.** F-40 removes `server.address` and `server.port` from spans of kind SERVER (counted `expected`); on CLIENT spans they name the outbound host Budmon chose (a bounded set). **Metrics:** the View for `http.server.request.duration` (and any other `http.server.*` instrument) uses an attribute allowlist **without** `server.address`/`server.port`; F-36's general allowlist keeps them for client instruments only. A configured public host isn't substituted: it carries no information. | F-36, F-40, TP-3.7, TP-3.11, TP-4.24 | none | planner decision |
| A-178 | D-3 (S-4 QA): a bad percent-encoding (`/api/v1/%zz…?t=token`) gets Fastify's native `FST_ERR_BAD_URL` 400 echoing the whole URL, without helmet headers, `X-Request-Id` or a log line; Node's 431 for oversized headers is similar. | **Pre-routing errors (Fastify):** F-55 sets Fastify's `frameworkErrors(error, request, reply)`: it answers **400** with the platform envelope `VALIDATION_FAILED`, `data.issues = [{ path: [], code: "invalid_url", message: "Request URL is not valid." }]` for `FST_ERR_BAD_URL` (and `invalid_request` / "Request is not valid." for any other framework error), applies F-61's headers through a shared `applySecurityHeaders(reply)`, sets `X-Request-Id`, and logs one `http_request` line with route `/unmatched` and the status. Nothing from the URL or headers is echoed. **Connection-level errors (Node):** F-55 sets Fastify's `clientErrorHandler(err, socket)`, which writes a fixed, bodiless response and closes: `400 Bad Request` for parse errors, `408 Request Timeout` for timeouts, `431 Request Header Fields Too Large` for `HPE_HEADER_OVERFLOW` (`Connection: close`, `Content-Length: 0`); no request exists, so no log line or request id, only the counter `http_client_errors_total{reason}` (F-42; reason `bad_request`, `timeout`, `headers_too_large`). | F-42, F-55, F-61, TP-4.30 (new) | none | planner decision |
| A-179 | O-1 (S-4 QA): `migrate` on a fresh database with no migration files exits 1: the grants step hits 42P01 on `currencies`, because tables come only from migrations, which exist only from the first release. | **Empty journal: nothing to grant yet.** In migrate mode, when the journal is empty (missing or `entries: []`) and no migration is recorded, F-19 stops after step 2 (roles, then F-18's `drizzle` schema and table, then A-130's grant) and reports zeros for the later steps; this is the state of every non-release build. The first release always ships its first migration (F-180), so production never deploys without tables. **With a non-empty journal**, a table listed in `tableGrants` that doesn't exist is a schema defect: F-16 throws `SchemaStepError("table_missing", table)` (exit 3) instead of a raw 42P01. | F-16, F-19, §6, TP-2.15 | none | planner decision |
| A-180 | O-2 (S-4 QA): shutdown has three 10 s step deadlines but no overall budget; `SIGTERM` took 8.1 s with a dead collector and 10 s with a stalled request, colliding with Docker's default 10 s grace. | **Overall budgets and matching grace periods.** F-90: one budget of **8 s** from `SIGTERM`: `app.close()` gets up to 5 s, then `container.close()` and `getTelemetry().shutdown()` share what remains (each at most 2 s); when the budget runs out the process exits 0 (unflushed telemetry is dropped). F-91: budget **35 s** (`stop()`'s 30 s graceful pg-boss stop, then 5 s for the rest). Compose (F-175) sets `stop_grace_period: 15s` for `api` and `45s` for `worker-general` and `worker-capture`, so Docker never kills a process inside its budget. New TP-4.29 checks the api's budget. | F-90, F-91, F-175, TP-4.29 (new), TP-6.13 | none | planner decision |
| A-181 | A-177's `http.server.*` View can't be built: in sdk-metrics 2.11 an instrument matched by two Views records every measurement twice, and View patterns can't exclude; `instrumentation-http` 0.222 never puts `server.address`/`server.port` on server metrics anyway (software-engineer, `f5c9973`). | **Option (a): no extra View; a test guards the fact.** A-177's metrics clause is replaced by: `http.server.*` instruments must not carry `server.address` or `server.port`; with the pinned `instrumentation-http` they don't, and TP-3.11 asserts it (with a canary `Host`). If an upgrade adds them, TP-3.11 fails and option (b) (a wrapping meter provider for the instrumentations) is the planned fix. A-177's span rule is unchanged. | F-36, A-177, TP-3.11 | none | planner decision |
| A-182 | `applySecurityHeaders(reply)` isn't defined in F-61; the engineer made it a fixed table in `security/headers.ts`, matching helmet's output, used only where helmet's hooks don't run (software-engineer). | **Confirmed:** `export const SECURITY_HEADERS: Readonly<Record<string, string>>` and `export function applySecurityHeaders(reply: { header(name: string, value: string): unknown }): void` in `platform/security/headers.ts`, holding exactly the headers F-61 lists (A-151). helmet keeps serving normal routes. **Drift test:** TP-5.1 compares a normal response's helmet headers with `SECURITY_HEADERS` (same names and values, nothing more or less), so a helmet upgrade can't silently diverge. | F-61, TP-5.1 | none | planner decision |
| A-183 | `frameworkErrors` writes F-38's log line itself but doesn't increment `http_server_requests_total` (software-engineer). | **It records the metrics too.** F-38 exports `export function recordRequest(deps: { logger: Logger; metrics: PlatformMetrics }, fields: { method: string; route: string; status: number; durationMs: number; clientKind: ClientKind; clientVersion: number \| null; requestId: string; userId?: string }): void` (the log line, `http_server_requests_total` and `http_server_duration_seconds`); F-38's hook and `frameworkErrors` both call it, the latter with route `/unmatched`. | F-38, F-55, TP-4.30 | none | planner decision |
| A-184 | Client-error mapping: `HPE_HEADER_OVERFLOW` → 431, `ERR_HTTP_REQUEST_TIMEOUT` → 408, anything else → 400; `ECONNRESET` and destroyed sockets ignored and not counted, as Fastify's default (software-engineer). | **Confirmed.** `reason` values: `headers_too_large` (431), `timeout` (408), `bad_request` (400). `ECONNRESET` or a socket that is already destroyed or not writable: nothing is written and nothing counted (the peer is gone). | F-42, F-55, TP-4.30 | none | planner decision |
| A-185 | A-179's empty-journal case is detected by `runSchemaStep` reading the journal again and checking F-18's `verified === 0`; F-18's return type is unchanged (software-engineer). | **Confirmed.** "Empty journal and no migration recorded" is `readJournal(...).length === 0` and F-18's result `verified === 0` (a recorded migration with an empty journal already throws `UnknownMigrationError`). No new F-18 field. | F-19 | none | planner decision |
| A-186 | N-1 (S-4 review, optional): A-176's `budmon.route` lands on `@fastify/otel`'s INTERNAL `handler` span; the SERVER span stays `GET /api/v1/*`, so backends group every API request under one name. | **Adopted, built in S-5** (S-4 is approved without it). The same F-55 interceptor that sets `budmon.route` also sets `getRPCMetadata(context.active()).route = "/api/v1" + <procedure's OpenAPI path template>` when RPC metadata exists. `instrumentation-http` then names the SERVER span `<METHOD> /api/v1/<template>` (e.g. `GET /api/v1/payees/{id}`) and sets its `http.route` and the `http.server.*` metrics' `http.route` to the template. The value comes only from the contract, passes F-30's `route` rule and A-164's span-name rule, and holds nothing from the request. Requests that match no procedure keep `/api/v1/*`. | F-55, S-5, TP-4.24 | none | planner decision |
| A-187 | TP-4.24's base row still expects `GET /api/v1/*` for the client-config SERVER span, contradicting A-186 (test-architect). | **Reworded:** the base check is "a SERVER span from `@opentelemetry/instrumentation-http` whose name starts with `GET /api/v1/`" (true before and after A-186); the A-186 case pins the exact names. | TP-4.24 | none | planner decision |
| A-188 | TP-5.10 has a test procedure echo `ctx.ip` "into the request log", but F-38 logs no IP and F-30 has no IP field (test-architect). | **The IP is never logged** (it's personal data; F-63 hashes it for rate limiting, and F-30 has no field for it). TP-5.10's test procedure returns `ctx.ip` in its response body instead, which is acceptable for a test-only contract. | TP-5.10, F-30 (note) | none | planner decision |
| A-189 | TP-5.9 calls `hmacSha256("key", …)` with a string; F-66 takes `key: Buffer` (test-architect). | **Row fixed:** `hmacSha256(Buffer.from("key"), "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog")`; the expected hex is unchanged. | TP-5.9 | none | planner decision |
| A-190 | TP-5.5's rolled-back case doesn't say what to assert (test-architect). | **Confirmed:** counters live outside the caller's transaction (F-63), so after a hit inside a rolled-back transaction the count is 3 and the next hit in the window is refused (`allowed: false`). | TP-5.5 | none | planner decision |
| A-191 | "Too many attempts" (journey J-3) vs the server's "Too many requests" in `PLATFORM_ERRORS`: which is the client text, and who owns it? (test-architect) | The server's `message` is a fixed **developer** message and is never shown to users. The user-facing text is the clients' catalogue entry `error.rateLimited` ("Too many attempts. Try again in # minute(s).", §8.1), rendered from `retryAfterSeconds`: web F-214 in **S-11b**, Android F-253 in **S-13**. S-5 tests assert only the envelope (`RATE_LIMITED`, `retryAfterSeconds`, `Retry-After`). | §6 (note), F-214, F-253 | none | planner decision |
| A-192 | The coarse limit (300/min per IP) applies to every in-process test app; should the harness configure or disable it? (test-architect) | **No knob.** A configuration switch for a security limit is one more way to ship it off. Each test file builds its own app, whose in-memory limit store starts empty, so ordinary suites stay far below 300; a test that needs more requests from one app varies `remoteAddress` per `inject`. | F-65, §10.1 (note) | none | planner decision |
| A-193 | F-80's rate-limit purge job is listed for S-5 but scheduled once S-6 lands (test-architect). | **Confirmed: it belongs to S-6.** S-5 delivers F-64's `deleteExpired` (TP-5.8); S-6 delivers the F-80 job that calls it on schedule, with TP-6.12 extended to the rate-limit purge. | S-5, S-6, TP-6.12 | none | planner decision |
| A-194 | `@fastify/rate-limit` throws `errorResponseBuilder`'s return value into Fastify's error handler, where F-62's handler would make it a 500 (software-engineer, `56735d5`). | **Confirmed:** the builder throws `CoarseRateLimitError` (code `BUDMON_RATE_LIMITED`, carrying `retryAfterSeconds`), and F-62's `setErrorHandler` answers it with the platform `RATE_LIMITED` 429 envelope `{ retryAfterSeconds }` and `Retry-After`, before its 500 fallback. | F-62, F-65 | none | planner decision |
| A-195 | The plugin's `x-ratelimit-limit`, `-remaining` and `-reset` headers are off; only `Retry-After` is sent (software-engineer). | **Confirmed:** they'd expose limiter state for no client need; clients use `Retry-After` and `retryAfterSeconds`. F-65 sets `addHeaders`/`addHeadersOnExceeding` so only `retry-after` is sent. | F-65 | none | planner decision |
| A-196 | `createRateLimiter` also throws `RangeError` when `windowSeconds` isn't an integer ≥ 1 (software-engineer). | **Confirmed** and added to F-63's errors. | F-63 | none | planner decision |
| A-197 | `@node-rs/argon2`'s `Algorithm` const enum is rejected by lint, so the code relies on the binding's default, Argon2id; TP-5.9 checks the `$argon2id$` prefix (software-engineer). | **Confirmed:** the default is Argon2id, and TP-5.9's PHC-prefix check (`$argon2id$v=19$m=19456,t=2,p=1$`) fails if a binding upgrade changes it. | F-66 | none | planner decision |
| A-198 | `createApiContainer` throws when there's neither `config.api` (for `rateLimitKey`) nor a `rateLimiter` override (software-engineer). | **Confirmed:** `Error("api config required")` (a programming error in tests or composition); production API configs always have `api`. | F-96 | none | planner decision |
| A-199 | A-186's route is set only when the active context holds HTTP-type RPC metadata; otherwise skipped (software-engineer). | **Confirmed:** without it (for example a procedure called in-process in tests) there's no SERVER span to rename; `budmon.route` is still set. | F-55 | none | planner decision |
| A-200 | N-3 (S-5 review): F-66's signature gives only `randomToken`'s default (32); the code accepts 16 to 64 bytes and throws `RangeError` otherwise (`randomToken(96)` throws). | **Confirmed.** F-66's errors already said 16..64; the signature comment now states it too. 16 bytes (128 bits) is the least any Budmon token may carry; 64 covers every planned use. A caller needing more is a design change, made by amendment. TP-5.9 checks 16, 64, 15, 65 and 96. | F-66, TP-5.9 | none | planner decision |
| A-201 | TP-6.13 and TP-6.15 can't register a test job in the built `worker.js` (test-architect, S-6). | **Testable entry, like `runMigrate`:** `main/worker.ts` exports `export async function runWorker(env: Readonly<Record<string, string \| undefined>>, overrides?: { registry?: JobRegistry; handlers?: ReadonlyMap<string, (payload: unknown, ctx: JobContext) => Promise<unknown>> }): Promise<{ stop(): Promise<void> }>`; its entry guard calls `runWorker(process.env)`. `overrides.registry` replaces `buildJobRegistry()` (A-202) and `overrides.handlers` are merged over `buildHandlerMap(c)`. **Bundle tests** spawn `node --import ./dist/main/instrument.js apps/server/test/fixtures/bundle/worker.mjs` (test-architect's), a fixture that imports `runWorker` from `dist/main/worker.js` (importing it doesn't run its entry guard) and passes the test registry and handlers. F-89 derives the process kind from the script's base name with `.js`, `.mjs` or `.ts` removed, so the fixture named `worker.mjs` gets worker telemetry. | F-89, F-91, TP-6.13, TP-6.15 | none | planner decision |
| A-202 | No function builds the production job registry; a real worker on a test copy fails with `MissingQueueError` on `platform.*` queues (test-architect). | New `export function buildJobRegistry(): JobRegistry` in `platform/queue/appRegistry.ts`: `createJobRegistry([...platformJobDefinitions, ...<each module's definitions>])` (modules add their arrays in their own slices, as with `handlers.ts`). Used by F-92 (`runSchemaStep`'s `jobRegistry`), `createApiContainer` and `createWorkerContainer` (`registry`). The test global setup (§10.1) runs the template's schema step with `createJobRegistry([...buildJobRegistry().all(), ...testJobDefinitions])`, so the template has every production queue plus the `test.*` ones. | F-71, F-92, F-96, §10.1 | none | planner decision |
| A-203 | F-78 step 4 enqueues `platform.fx-gap-check` (F-139, a later slice), which breaks any general worker whose registry lacks it (test-architect). | **Only when registered:** step 4 enqueues it when `c.registry.get("platform.fx-gap-check")` exists; S-9 registers it. | F-78, TP-6.9 | none | planner decision |
| A-204 | A-179's early stop contradicts TP-2.15 (c) (migrate mode with an empty journal on a pushed database expects queue fields); what's `queueSchema` when the step stops early? (test-architect) | **A-179 narrowed to a fresh database:** the early path applies when the journal is empty, no migration is recorded **and none of `tableGrants`' tables exists** (A-185's check plus that one). On it, F-19 runs steps 1, 2, 3 (queue schema) and 6 (queue sync), and F-16 only its step 5 (A-130's `drizzle` grant); steps 4's table grants and 5 (reference data) are skipped and report `currenciesUpserted: 0`. So `queueSchema` and `queuesCreated` always carry real values. A pushed database (tables exist) runs every step, as TP-2.15 (c) expects. | F-19, A-179, A-185, TP-2.15 | none | planner decision |
| A-205 | `syncQueues(boss, registry)` has no logger for `warn("queue_unregistered")` (test-architect). | Signature becomes `syncQueues(boss: PgBoss, registry: JobRegistry, logger: Logger)`. | F-75, TP-6.6 | none | planner decision |
| A-206 | F-79 has no logger for `warn("heartbeat_write_failed")`; is its `metrics` F-41's `Metrics` or `PlatformMetrics`? (test-architect) | F-79's deps gain `logger: Logger`; `metrics` is **`PlatformMetrics`** (F-42 registers `worker_heartbeat_timestamp_seconds`; F-79 observes it, it doesn't create instruments). | F-79, TP-6.10 | none | planner decision |
| A-207 | F-76's `attempt` is undefined (test-architect). | **Confirmed as assumed:** `attempt = job.retryCount + 1` (pg-boss counts retries from 0); the last attempt is `attempt === retryLimit + 1`, and `jobs_dead_lettered_total` is incremented when an attempt fails with `attempt > retryLimit`. | F-76, TP-6.7 | none | planner decision |
| A-208 | Healthcheck: is the 60 s measured on the file content or its mtime? Its fixed port 3000 forces tests to bind 3000 (test-architect). | **Content:** `--heartbeat` parses the file's epoch seconds (F-79 writes them) and compares with the current time; an unreadable or non-numeric file exits 1. **Port:** `--ready` requests `http://127.0.0.1:${PORT}/health/ready`, with `PORT` from the environment (default 3000), the same variable the api listens on. | F-175 (health checks), TP-6.10 | none | planner decision |
| A-209 | Who calls `start()` on the api's send-only pg-boss (`BaseContainer.boss`)? (test-architect) | **F-90 step 4b:** `await container.boss.start()` after `createApiContainer`, before `listen`; `container.close()` stops it within the shutdown budget (A-180). Workers start theirs in F-78 step 1. | F-90 | none | planner decision |
| A-210 | F-80's handler exports aren't named; does `idempotency_purged` log once per run or per batch? (test-architect) | **Exports** in `platform/maintenance/maintenanceJobs.ts`: `platformMaintenanceJobs` (the three definitions), `purgeIdempotencyRecords(deps: { database: Database; clock: Clock; logger: Logger }): Promise<number>`, `purgeRateLimitCounters(deps: same): Promise<number>`, and `maintenanceHandlers(c: WorkerContainer)` (the handler map merged by `buildHandlerMap`). **One log line per run** with the total: `info("idempotency_purged", { count })` and `info("rate_limits_purged", { count })`. | F-80, TP-6.12 | none | planner decision |

## 1. Deviations from the HLD, and decisions the HLD left open

**Deviations** (each needs the reviewer's acceptance):

| # | HLD says | LLD does | Why |
| - | -------- | -------- | --- |
| DV-1 | D-24/D-25: "Alloy's dropped-attribute and dropped-label counters are exported, and any drop alerts". (Alloy and alerts exist from stage 1; the application-side counters below are in the code from day one.) | Alloy enforces the allowlist for logs, spans and metrics. It **counts** drops only for logs (`loki.process` `stage.metrics`). Span-attribute and metric-label drops are counted where they're enforced first, in the application: `telemetry_attributes_dropped_total{signal, drop_kind}` (F-40, F-41). Attributes that the OpenTelemetry instrumentations always emit and that the allowlist always removes (a declared list, F-40) count as `drop_kind="expected"` and **don't alert**; anything else is `unexpected` and alerts. Instrumentation **metrics** are filtered by an OpenTelemetry View allowlist (F-36) without counting. The alert fires on `unexpected` span or metric drops, or on any Alloy log drop. | Alloy's OTLP processors (`otelcol.processor.transform`) can delete attributes but expose no per-drop counter. The application layer sees every attribute first, so counting there catches the same bugs. The rehearsal canary scan still checks Alloy's exported output (D-41). |
| DV-2 | D-20: `APP_ENV` is `development`, `test` or `production`; production refuses the local key provider. D-41: the rehearsal uses a local key provider with production-shaped configuration. | A fourth value, **`APP_ENV=rehearsal`**. Every production rule applies, except that `KMS_PROVIDER=local` is accepted. `db:reset` refuses it like production. | Otherwise the rehearsal could either not use a local KMS stand-in or not apply production's validation. It's an environment, not a stage setting: it never selects topology (D-29 rule 3 (a)). |
| DV-3 | D-7 table: a Kobalte vs Ark UI spike decides the primitives library. | **Kobalte** (`@kobalte/core` 0.13.14). The spike (dialog, combobox, date field, menu) is acceptance criterion AC-11.4 of S-11b; if it fails, an amendment switches to Ark UI. | An LLD can't leave a dependency open; Kobalte is the HLD's primary choice. |
| DV-5 | HLD §3.1 convention: every table has `created_at` and `updated_at`. | `rate_limit_counters` has neither (§3.1). | Unlogged, short-lived counters (expired every 10 minutes); the timestamps would add a write per sensitive request and serve no story. |
| DV-4 | D-25: `capture_connections{…}` and `capture_connections_stale{…}` gauges are computed by a worker-general job. | The platform provides the metric registry, the label allowlist (including `source_kind`, `connection_status`, `age_bucket`) and observable gauges (F-41). **The gauge job itself is specified in the `sources` LLD**, which owns the connection tables. | The platform can't query tables that don't exist yet. |

**Decisions the HLD left open, made here** (planner decisions):
- Exact package versions (§2.4), environment variables (§4.2), the error-envelope JSON (§5.1), the envelope byte format (§4.8), the cursor format (§4.7), job retry policies (§4.6), and the FX parsing and conversion rules (§4.9).
- **Readiness window:** at most **one** applied migration that the code doesn't know (§4.4 F-57). Each release or hotfix carries at most one migration (D-12), so this equals "at most one later release".
- **Web build number:** `git rev-list --count <tag>`, baked into the web image and sent as `X-Budmon-Client: web/<n>` (F-185). The server-release sequence number is the stage-1 LLD's.
- **Database role creation:** `budmon_migrator` has `CREATEROLE`, and is granted `SET` on `budmon_queue` so the schema step can act as the queue owner without holding its password. The superuser `budmon_admin` is reachable only through the container's Unix socket.
- **Payload safety:** job payload strings must match a short-token pattern (§4.6), which enforces D-10's "IDs, enums, dates, counts" at runtime.
- **The web image is Caddy:** upstream `caddy` plus the built SPA. On the laptop it serves plain HTTP on `127.0.0.1:8080`, and Tailscale Serve terminates TLS (F-175).
- **Stage-0 laptop:** images are built locally from the tag by `budmon-local` (no registry); local secret files instead of SOPS (F-191); a pre-upgrade dump of the last 5 releases (F-178); an FX gap check job (F-139).

## 2. File plan

### 2.1 Removed (D-34)

| Path | Action |
| ---- | ------ |
| `server/` (whole directory, including `dist/`, `src/**`, `drizzle.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`, `package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `.env.example`, `.gitignore`) | Delete. Replaced by `apps/server/` and the root workspace. |
| `compose.yaml` (root) | Delete. Replaced by `infra/compose.yaml`. |
| `code-bites.md` | Delete. |
| `.prettierrc` | Delete. Replaced by `prettier.config.js`. |
| `README.md` (empty) | Rewrite (layout, prerequisites, commands, environments). |
| `.zed/settings.json` | Keep. |

### 2.2 Created: root and packages

| File | Responsibility |
| ---- | -------------- |
| `package.json` | Private workspace root. Scripts: exactly those in §2.2.2, each added by its owning slice (A-14). `packageManager: pnpm@10.x` (pinned), `engines.node: ">=24 <25"`. `devDependencies` hold the root tooling (§2.4) and `@budmon/shared: "workspace:*"` (S-1, for TP-1.14; A-43). |
| `pnpm-workspace.yaml` | Workspaces: `apps/server`, `apps/web`, `packages/*`, `infra/budmonctl`, `tools/*`. `peerDependencyRules.allowedVersions` with exactly one entry, `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y>eslint: "10"` (S-0, A-13); no other peer rules. `ignoredBuiltDependencies: ["cpu-features", "esbuild", "protobufjs", "ssh2"]` (sorted; `esbuild` from S-0, A-32; the other three from S-2 with Testcontainers, A-65) and no `onlyBuiltDependencies`. pnpm settings live only here: the root `package.json` has no `pnpm` field (A-65). |
| `.nvmrc` | `24`. Every `actions/setup-node` step reads it with `node-version-file: .nvmrc` (A-87, TP-0.25). |
| `.gitattributes` | Line-ending rules for the owner's Windows laptop (HLD D-29) (S-0, A-9). Exact content below (§2.2.1). |
| `.gitignore` | `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `.data/`, `.env*` except `.env.example`, `coverage/`, `playwright-report/`, `test-results/`, Android `build/`, `.gradle/`, `local.properties`. |
| `.editorconfig`, `prettier.config.js`, `eslint.config.js`, `stylelint.config.js` | Root configs; the last three import from `@budmon/config`. The first three are S-0's; `stylelint.config.js` (`export default` of `@budmon/config/stylelint`) is S-11a's (A-14). |
| `vitest.config.ts` | Root Vitest configuration with `test.projects` (§10.1, A-8). Owned by the test-architect. There is no `vitest.workspace.*` file. |
| `.env.example` | Every variable in §4.2 with safe development values. |
| `README.md` | Layout, prerequisites, commands, environments, the stage model (link to the HLD). **S-2 writes** `## Prerequisites`, `## First run`, `## Configuration`, `## Database commands`, `## Tests`, `## Layout` (content in A-85); S-4, S-11a/S-11b, S-13, S-14 and S-15 extend them as A-85 lists. |
| `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | CI steps 1 to 6 (D-27), plus calls to `rehearsal.yml` (§4.17). Triggers: `pull_request` with `types: [opened, synchronize, reopened, labeled, unlabeled]` (so adding or removing a merge-back label re-runs the checks, A-7) and `push` to `main`. The `migrations` job's F-6 step is defined in F-6 (A-7). |
| `.github/workflows/rehearsal.yml` | Reusable release rehearsal, stage-0 shape (D-41, F-195). |
| `.github/workflows/tag.yml` | Stage-0 tagging: on a merged `release/*` PR, or dispatched with a hotfix PR number, re-runs check (i) on the commit and pushes the tag with `GITHUB_TOKEN` through `tools/ci/tagRelease.sh` (§4.17 "Stage-0 tagging", TP-14.10). `permissions: contents: write` only. The stage-1 LLD replaces it with the App-based chain. |
| `.github/workflows/*.yml`, `*.yaml` (rules for every workflow, A-17) | (1) Every `uses:`, at job level (reusable workflows) and step level, is pinned to a full 40-hex commit SHA (`owner/repo[/path]@<40 lowercase hex>`, a version comment after it is allowed); references starting with `./` (local actions and reusable workflows in this repository) are exempt. (2) No `run:` script contains `${{`: values reach scripts only through `env:` (`${{ }}` is allowed in `env:`, `with:`, `if:` and other keys). Enforced by TP-0.23 from S-0; every later slice that adds or edits a workflow keeps to them. |
| `packages/test-support/` (`@budmon/test-support`) | Test tooling owned by the test-architect: `src/canaries.ts` (F-198), shared fakes and helpers (§10.1) (S-3). A `devDependency` (`workspace:*`) of the root and of `@budmon/server` only; never a runtime dependency or bundled (A-102). |
| `packages/config/` (`@budmon/config`) | `tsconfig/base.json`, `tsconfig/node.json`, `tsconfig/web.json`, exported as `./tsconfig/*.json` (consumers write `@budmon/config/tsconfig/node.json`, A-66); `eslint/index.js` (F-1); `eslint/rules/*.js` (custom ESLint rules F-2, F-3, F-3b; S-0); `prettier/index.js`; `stylelint/index.js` (F-4; S-11a, exported as `./stylelint`, A-14). |
| `packages/shared/` (`@budmon/shared`) | `src/money/*`, `src/time/*`, `src/ids/*`, `src/i18n/*`, `src/json/canonical.ts`, `src/index.ts`, `test-vectors/*.json` (S-1). |
| `packages/contract/` (`@budmon/contract`) | `src/common/{money,dates,ids,cursor,errors,create,version}.ts`, `src/meta/metaContract.ts`, `src/index.ts`, `src/rules/contractRules.ts`, `scripts/emitOpenapi.ts`, `openapi.json` (S-4). |
| `infra/budmonctl/` (`@budmon/budmonctl`) | The owner-side CLI in TypeScript: `src/cli.ts`, `src/scram.ts` (F-190), `src/localSecrets.ts` (F-191) (S-15). |
| `tools/ci/` (`@budmon/tools-ci`) | Sources sit at the package root (`tools/ci/<name>.ts`; there is no `src/` directory, A-7); tests in `tools/ci/test/`. `package.json` has `tsx` (latest 4.x, pinned in the lockfile) as a dev dependency for the CLIs. `checkMigrationFiles.ts`, `checkMergeBack.ts`, `checkApiMinor.ts`, `checkCatalogs.ts`, `checkEnvExample.ts`, `buildNumber.ts`, `tagRelease.sh` (the stage-0 tagging step, §4.17 "Stage-0 tagging") (S-0, S-2, S-4, S-11a, S-14, S-15). |
| `tools/rehearsal/` (`@budmon/tools-rehearsal`) | Rehearsal harness: `src/run.ts`, `src/fakeGoogle.ts`, `src/fakeFx.ts`, `src/sentryCapture.ts`, `src/needles.ts` (F-193, A-24) (S-16). |

#### 2.2.1 `.gitattributes` (S-0, A-9)

Exact content (comments may be reworded; the non-comment lines, their order and their attributes are fixed and checked by TP-0.18):

```gitattributes
# Line endings (HLD D-29: the owner's laptop runs Windows; scripts run in WSL2 and containers).
* text=auto eol=lf

# Shell scripts stay LF on every checkout, or bash fails on "\r".
*.sh text eol=lf
*.bash text eol=lf
*.bats text eol=lf
gradlew text eol=lf
infra/local/budmon-local text eol=lf

# Windows-only scripts.
*.bat text eol=crlf
*.cmd text eol=crlf
*.ps1 text eol=crlf

# Binary files: no line-ending conversion and no textual diff.
*.png binary
*.jpg binary
*.jar binary
*.keystore binary
*.dump binary
```

`gradlew` and `infra/local/budmon-local` are listed before they exist (S-13, S-15) so that they are LF from their first commit. The S-0 commit re-normalises the index (`git add --renormalize .`), so no tracked text file is stored with CRLF.

#### 2.2.2 Root scripts (A-14)

The root `package.json` `scripts` hold exactly these entries. Each slice adds its own rows (and S-11a, S-13 replace the command of a row as stated); no slice adds a script before its owning slice. Root scripts that delegate use `pnpm --filter <package> <name>`, and the package's script of the same name holds the command in the third column; pnpm appends extra arguments at both levels (`pnpm db:release-migration v0.1.0`). Package scripts run with the package directory as working directory, so a CLI that takes repository paths resolves relative arguments against `process.env.INIT_CWD` (set by pnpm to the directory it was invoked from).

| Script | Root command | Package script command | Defined by | Slice |
| ------ | ------------ | ---------------------- | ---------- | ----- |
| `format` | `prettier --write .` | | F-5 | S-0 |
| `format:check` | `prettier --check .` | | F-5 | S-0 |
| `lint` | S-0: `eslint .`; from S-11a: `eslint . && pnpm lint:css` | | F-1, F-4 | S-0, changed in S-11a |
| `typecheck` | S-0: `tsc -p tsconfig.json`; from S-2: `tsc -p tsconfig.json && tsc -p apps/server/tsconfig.json`; from S-11a: `tsc -p tsconfig.json && tsc -p apps/server/tsconfig.json && tsc -p apps/web/tsconfig.json` (A-30) | | F-5 | S-0, changed in S-2 and S-11a |
| `test` | `vitest run --project=!server-int` | | §10.1 | S-0 |

### 2.3 Created: applications, images and infrastructure

| Path | Responsibility |
| ---- | -------------- |
| `apps/server/package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `drizzle.config.ts`, `drizzle/` (empty until the first release), `scripts/build.ts` (F-24, A-43) | Server workspace. `package.json`: script `build` = `tsx scripts/build.ts`; `@budmon/*` packages and `esbuild` are `devDependencies`; everything the bundle imports at run time is in `dependencies` (A-43). `tsconfig.json` (S-2, A-30, A-67): extends `@budmon/config/tsconfig/node.json`, `noEmit: true`, `resolveJsonModule: true`, `include: ["src/**/*.ts", "scripts/**/*.ts", "test/**/*.ts", "drizzle.config.ts"]`. |
| `apps/server/src/main/{api,worker,migrate,cli,dbReset,dev}.ts` | Process entry points (F-90 to F-95). |

| `apps/server/src/i18n/{messages/en.json,render.ts}` | F-160 (server-side message rendering for emails and pushes; no messages until `identity`/`notifications`). |
| `apps/server/test/**` | Test-architect's (§10.1). |
| `apps/web/` | SolidJS SPA (§8.1, F-200 to F-221). `tsconfig.json` (S-11a, A-30): extends `@budmon/config/tsconfig/web.json`, `noEmit: true`, `include: ["src/**/*.ts", "src/**/*.tsx", "test/**/*.ts", "test/**/*.tsx", "e2e/**/*.ts", "vite.config.ts"]`. |
| `apps/android/` | Gradle project: `app/`, `lint-rules/`, `gradle/libs.versions.toml` (§8.2, F-250 to F-263). |
| `images/server/Dockerfile` | Server image (api, worker, migrate, cli entry points; api and worker always start with `node --import ./dist/main/instrument.js`, A-147). Build stage: `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, then `pnpm --filter @budmon/server build` (F-24). Runtime stage: `apps/server/package.json`, `dist/`, `drizzle/`, `src/*/assets/` and a production install of the server's `dependencies` (`pnpm --filter @budmon/server deploy --prod`), laid out so `serverRoot()` (F-25) is the image's app directory (S-15, A-43). |
| `images/web/Dockerfile` | Upstream `caddy` plus the built SPA. |
| `images/postgres/{Dockerfile,budmon-entrypoint.sh,postgresql.base.conf}` | Postgres 18 plus pgBackRest, with the boot safeguards (F-170). |
| `infra/compose.yaml` | Local development: Postgres (same image as production) and Mailpit (D-28). Every `image:` is digest-pinned; Postgres uses `POSTGRES_IMAGE`'s reference and Mailpit the same reference as `infra/local/compose.main.yaml` (A-70). |
| `infra/local/` | The stage-0 laptop stack: `compose.main.yaml`, `compose.capture.yaml`, `local.env`, `Caddyfile`, `postgres/{postgresql.conf,pg_hba.conf,pg_ident.conf}` (F-175); `budmon-local` and `lib/{common,secrets,release,stack}.sh` (F-178); `test/*.bats`; `gcp-bootstrap.sh` (F-179); `rehearsal/compose.rehearsal.yaml` (F-195); `wslconfig.example` (`[wsl2]` `memory=6GB`, and `# networkingMode=mirrored` commented out with a note: Docker Desktop has had problems with mirrored mode, including port publishing to Windows' `localhost`; verify on the pinned Docker Desktop version before enabling) (S-15). |
| `infra/runbooks/stage0-laptop.md` | Windows laptop setup (S-15), in this order: (1) enable WSL2 and install Ubuntu LTS; (2) Docker Desktop (WSL2 backend, WSL integration for the distribution, start at login); (3) copy `wslconfig.example` to `%UserProfile%\.wslconfig` (NAT networking; mirrored stays commented out); (4) check BitLocker or device encryption is on (A-14); (5) clone into `~/src/budmon`, `git config core.autocrlf false`, Node 24, pnpm, `gcloud`, `sudo` for the WSL user; (6) Tailscale on Windows and the phone, MagicDNS and HTTPS certificates enabled; (7) B2 buckets and keys (§7.4), the Sentry project, the Google OAuth client with redirect `http://localhost:8080/api/v1/…` (A-16), the separate "Budmon sign-in" web client (scopes `openid email profile`, redirect `http://localhost:8080/api/v1/auth/google/callback`) and its Android client (A-3), and the OXR app id; (8) `~/src/budmon/infra/local/budmon-local install <tag>`, answering the prompts; it stops at the placeholder check (exit 20); (9) `gcp-bootstrap.sh --project <p>` and the printed service-account key command; (10) `budmon-local secret set …` for every remaining placeholder; (11) `budmon-local install <tag>` again; (12) add `~/.budmon/bin` to `PATH`; (13) `tailscale serve` as printed; (14) open the Tailscale URL on the laptop and on the phone; (15) `budmon-local bootstrap-owner --email <owner address>` and open the printed link to create the owner account (A-6); emails are read in Mailpit at `http://127.0.0.1:8025` on the laptop (A-2); (16) checklist (A-4): Caddy's access log shows `/api/v1/auth/google/callback` without its query string, and Tailscale Serve keeps no access log of query strings (it has none by default; confirm no `tailscale serve` logging or funnel is enabled). Repository setting: "Allow merge commits" stays on, and hotfix merge-back PRs are merged with "Create a merge commit" (§4.17). Broken cluster (Postgres won't start, so `restore` exits 18): stop the stack, move `~/.budmon/pg` aside (never delete it), `budmon-local maintenance on`, recreate an empty `pg/` owned by 999 and run first setup with the current tag's files, then `restore` the chosen dump. Android: Android Studio and `adb` on Windows, from a Windows-side clone used only for Android work; the emulator uses debug builds against the development stack (`pnpm dev`, `http://10.0.2.2:5173/`); the phone gets the `stage0` release build (with `~/.budmon/android.properties`) over `adb` Wi-Fi debugging from Windows. Gmail: while the OAuth app is in testing mode, reconnect from the laptop's browser when the connection shows "needs reconnect" (about weekly). |

## 3. Database

### 3.1 Table definitions

Drizzle, `casing: "snake_case"` (TypeScript properties camelCase, columns snake_case), schema `public`. Every table is registered in `apps/server/src/db/schema/index.ts` and has a row in `tableGrants` (F-16).

```ts
// apps/server/src/db/schema/currencies.ts
export const currenciesTable = pgTable("currencies", {
  code: char({ length: 3 }).primaryKey(),
  name: text().notNull(),
  minorUnits: smallint().notNull(),
  isActive: boolean().notNull().default(true),
  createdAt: timestamp({ withTimezone: true }).notNull().defaultNow(),
  updatedAt: timestamp({ withTimezone: true }).notNull().defaultNow(),
}, (t) => [
  check("currencies_code_format", sql`${t.code} ~ '^[A-Z]{3}$'`),
  check("currencies_minor_units_range", sql`${t.minorUnits} BETWEEN 0 AND 4`),
]);

// apps/server/src/db/schema/exchangeRates.ts
export const exchangeRatesTable = pgTable("exchange_rates", {
  currencyCode: char({ length: 3 }).notNull()
    .references(() => currenciesTable.code, { onDelete: "restrict", onUpdate: "restrict" }),
  rateDate: date({ mode: "string" }).notNull(),
  unitsPerUsd: numeric({ precision: 24, scale: 12 }).notNull(),
  provider: text().notNull(),
  fetchedAt: timestamp({ withTimezone: true }).notNull(),
  createdAt: timestamp({ withTimezone: true }).notNull().defaultNow(),
  updatedAt: timestamp({ withTimezone: true }).notNull().defaultNow(),
}, (t) => [
  primaryKey({ columns: [t.currencyCode, t.rateDate] }),
  index("exchange_rates_rate_date_idx").on(t.rateDate),
  check("exchange_rates_positive", sql`${t.unitsPerUsd} > 0`),
  check("exchange_rates_provider", sql`${t.provider} IN ('openexchangerates', 'fawazahmed0', 'fixed')`),
]);

// apps/server/src/db/schema/idempotencyRecords.ts
export const idempotencyRecordsTable = pgTable("idempotency_records", {
  userId: uuid().notNull(),              // FK to identity's users table, declared in identity's schema (HLD §3.1)
  idempotencyKey: uuid().notNull(),
  procedure: text().notNull(),           // contract path, e.g. "transactions.create"
  requestHash: bytea().notNull(),        // 32 bytes, SHA-256 of canonical input
  responseStatus: smallint(),            // null until the create completes in the same transaction
  result: jsonb().$type<{ id: string; createdAt: string }>(),
  createdAt: timestamp({ withTimezone: true }).notNull().defaultNow(),
  updatedAt: timestamp({ withTimezone: true }).notNull().defaultNow(),
  expiresAt: timestamp({ withTimezone: true }).notNull(),
}, (t) => [
  primaryKey({ columns: [t.userId, t.idempotencyKey] }),
  index("idempotency_records_expires_at_idx").on(t.expiresAt),
  check("idempotency_records_hash_len", sql`octet_length(${t.requestHash}) = 32`),
]);

// apps/server/src/db/schema/rateLimitCounters.ts  (UNLOGGED: see below)
export const rateLimitCountersTable = pgTable("rate_limit_counters", {
  bucketKey: text().notNull(),           // "<limiter>:<base64url HMAC-SHA-256(subject)>"
  windowStart: timestamp({ withTimezone: true }).notNull(),
  hits: integer().notNull(),
  expiresAt: timestamp({ withTimezone: true }).notNull(),
}, (t) => [
  primaryKey({ columns: [t.bucketKey, t.windowStart] }),
  index("rate_limit_counters_expires_at_idx").on(t.expiresAt),
]);
```

- `bytea` is a custom Drizzle type (`customType<{ data: Buffer }>`) in `apps/server/src/db/schema/types.ts`.
- **`UNLOGGED`:** Drizzle has no flag for it. The push step (F-17) and the baseline release migration run `ALTER TABLE rate_limit_counters SET UNLOGGED` immediately after creation. The release migration notes (§3.4) carry this. `rate_limit_counters` has no `created_at`/`updated_at`, a documented exception to HLD §3.1's convention: rows are short-lived counters.
- `exchange_rates.provider = 'fixed'` exists only in development and test data; production's FX config refuses the fixed provider (§4.2).
- `idempotency_records.user_id` has no foreign key until `identity` creates its users table. `identity`'s LLD adds the FK with `onDelete: cascade` in its schema, and it ships in the same baseline release migration.

**Non-Drizzle stores:**
- `pgboss` schema: owned by `budmon_queue`, installed by F-74.
- `drizzle.__drizzle_migrations`: Drizzle's migrator, deployed and release-path databases only.
- Buckets `exports` and `erasure-log` (F-140). The `backups` bucket (pgBackRest) is stage 1 (§7.4).

### 3.2 Changes to existing tables

The existing `users`, `accounts`, `account_owners`, `refresh_tokens` and `currencies` (integer id) tables are deleted with `server/` (D-34). No database holds data that must survive (spec §7 item 1), so there's no data migration.

### 3.3 Roles, grants and reference data

**Login roles** are created by the schema step (F-15), except `budmon_admin` and `budmon_migrator`, which cluster bootstrap creates (F-14).

| Role | Attributes | Used by | Privileges |
| ---- | ---------- | ------- | ---------- |
| `budmon_admin` | SUPERUSER, LOGIN | Owner (`docker exec -u postgres … psql -U budmon_admin`), `budmon-local`'s `pg_dump`/`pg_restore`, and pgBackRest from stage 1, over the container's Unix socket only: `pg_hba` `local all budmon_admin peer map=local_admin`, with `pg_ident.conf` mapping OS user `postgres` to `budmon_admin`; no `host` line | All. |
| `budmon_migrator` | LOGIN, CREATEROLE, NOINHERIT | `migrate` container; dev/test schema step; `cli restore:verify` | Owns database `budmon` and schema `public`. Granted `budmon_queue` `WITH SET TRUE, INHERIT FALSE`; `pg_read_all_data` `WITH INHERIT TRUE`; `pg_monitor` `WITH ADMIN TRUE, INHERIT FALSE, SET FALSE`; `EXECUTE` on `bt_index_check`. Has ADMIN on the roles it creates. |
| `budmon_app` | LOGIN, NOINHERIT | api, worker-general (domain writes) | Per `tableGrants` (F-16). On schema `drizzle` (when it exists): `USAGE` and `SELECT` on `__drizzle_migrations` only, for F-57's readiness check (A-130). On `pgboss`: `USAGE` on the schema, `SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE` on its tables and `EXECUTE` on its functions, through `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES FOR ROLE budmon_queue IN SCHEMA pgboss`. |
| `budmon_capture` | LOGIN, NOINHERIT | worker-capture | Per `tableGrants`. On `pgboss`: the same as `budmon_app`; pg-boss runs with maintenance and scheduling off (F-77). |
| `budmon_queue` | LOGIN, NOINHERIT | worker-general's pg-boss connections | Owns schema `pgboss`. |
| `budmon_monitor` | LOGIN, NOINHERIT; member of `pg_monitor` **WITH INHERIT TRUE** | Alloy's postgres exporter (from stage 1; the role is created from the first release so the schema step is the same in every stage) | `CONNECT`, plus `pg_monitor`'s statistics views. |

`REVOKE CREATE ON SCHEMA public FROM PUBLIC` and `REVOKE ALL ON DATABASE budmon FROM PUBLIC` are applied by F-15.

**Platform table grants** (`tableGrants`, F-16):

| Table | `budmon_app` | `budmon_capture` | Credential table? |
| ----- | ------------ | ---------------- | ----------------- |
| `currencies` | SELECT | SELECT | no |
| `exchange_rates` | SELECT, INSERT | SELECT | no |
| `idempotency_records` | SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE | none | no |
| `rate_limit_counters` | SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE | none | no |

`currencies` writes happen only in the schema step as `budmon_migrator`.

**Reference data:** `apps/server/src/platform/fx/iso4217.json` is an array of `{ "code": "EGP", "name": "Egyptian Pound", "minorUnits": 2, "active": true }`. **Sources (A-69):** codes, `active` and `minorUnits` from ISO 4217 List One (current, published by SIX); kept withdrawn currencies from List Three (its minor units, else 2); `name` = CLDR English display name (`Intl.DisplayNames("en", { type: "currency" })` on Node 24), display only, kept verbatim with CLDR's own casing (A-78). Regenerating the file is a reviewed change.
- It contains every currency in ISO 4217 table A.1 (as published by SIX on the date the slice is built), plus currencies withdrawn since 2000-01-01 (table A.3) with `active: false`.
- It excludes metals (XAU, XAG, XPT, XPD), XDR, the bond-market units XBA to XBD, XSU, XUA, the testing and "no currency" codes XTS and XXX, and every fund code (BOV, CHE, CHW, CLF, COU, MXV, USN, UYI, UYW).
- Names are CLDR English display names (A-69). The file is loaded by F-21.

### 3.4 Migration and seed data

- **Development and test:** no migration files. Databases are built by the schema step in `push` mode onto an empty database (F-17, F-20).
- **First release:** `pnpm db:release-migration v0.1.0` (F-180) generates `apps/server/drizzle/0000_v0.1.0.sql`, the baseline.
- **Release migration notes** (the platform's part of every release until this LLD amends them):

| Release | Note |
| ------- | ---- |
| Baseline (first release) | Creates the four platform tables. The software-engineer appends `ALTER TABLE "rate_limit_counters" SET UNLOGGED;` after its `CREATE TABLE` (the generator omits it). No data to preserve. The upgrade test is skipped for the baseline (no previous release, F-183). |

- **Seed data (development only):** the seed framework (F-23) runs registered seeders in registration order. The platform's seeder inserts `exchange_rates` for the 30 days before today (UTC) for USD, EUR, GBP, EGP, JPY, KWD and SAR, with provider `fixed`, using the fixed provider's rates (F-133).

## 4. Function catalog

### 4.0 Conventions for this catalog

- Paths are relative to the repository root. Server paths are under `apps/server/src/`; the catalog writes `platform/...` for `apps/server/src/platform/...`.
- **Injectable dependencies** (fakeable in unit tests) are marked **[inj]**. They're passed through constructor or factory parameters, never imported as singletons (D-31).
- `Temporal` always comes from `@budmon/shared` (F-310).
- "Throws `X`" means an exception. "Returns" means a normal result.
- Platform `BudmonError`s are listed in §6. Errors that aren't `BudmonError` become `INTERNAL` at the API boundary (F-52).
- **Shared types** used across the catalog:

```ts
// platform/db/types.ts
import type { NodePgDatabase } from "drizzle-orm/node-postgres";
import type * as schema from "../../db/schema/index.js";
export type Schema = typeof schema;
export type Executor = NodePgDatabase<Schema>;
export interface SqlResult { rows: Record<string, unknown>[]; rowCount: number }
export interface DbHandle {
  readonly db: Executor;                        // drizzle bound to the pool or to the open transaction
  executeSql(text: string, values?: readonly unknown[]): Promise<SqlResult>;
  readonly inTransaction: boolean;
}
export interface Database { readonly handle: DbHandle; readonly pool: import("pg").Pool; close(): Promise<void> }
export interface CommitTracker { readonly committed: boolean; markCommitted(): void }

// platform/http/context.ts
export interface Principal { readonly userId: string; readonly isOwner: boolean; readonly sessionId: string } // sessionId: A-1 (identity PA-1)
export type ClientKind = "android" | "web" | "other";
export interface RequestContext {
  readonly requestId: string;                   // = trace id (32 hex) when a trace is active, else UUIDv7 without dashes
  readonly principal: Principal | null;
  readonly clientKind: ClientKind;
  readonly clientVersion: number | null;
  readonly ip: string;
  readonly method?: string;                     // A-171: upper-case HTTP method, set by F-55; absent → no coercion; coercion only for GET (A-173, A-175)
  readonly headers: Readonly<Record<string, string | undefined>>; // lower-cased names
  readonly responseHeaders: Headers;            // oRPC ResponseHeadersPlugin
  readonly commitTracker: CommitTracker;
  readonly logger: Logger;
  readonly container: ApiContainer;
}
```

### 4.1 Repository tooling (S-0)

#### F-1: `createBudmonEslintConfig`
- **File:** `packages/config/eslint/index.js` · **Layer:** config
- **Signature:** `export function createBudmonEslintConfig(options: { tsconfigRootDir: string }): import("eslint").Linter.Config[]`
- **Behaviour:** returns a flat config with typescript-eslint `strictTypeChecked`, Prettier compatibility, and these rules, all `error`:
  1. **Layering** (`no-restricted-imports`; every entry has a `message`, A-27: exact names as `paths` entries, globs as `patterns` groups):
     - files `apps/server/src/*/*Router.ts` may not import `drizzle-orm*`, `pg` or `**/db/**` (message **L-1** "Layering: routers don't use the database. Call the module's service (*Service.ts) instead.") or `**/*Repo.js` (**L-2** "Layering: routers don't import repositories. Call the module's service (*Service.ts) instead.");
     - files `apps/server/src/*/*Service.ts` and `apps/server/src/platform/*/*Service.ts` (exactly these two globs, A-11) may not import `drizzle-orm*` or `pg` (**L-3** "Layering: services don't build queries. Call the module's repository (*Repo.ts) with the DbHandle you were given.") or `**/db/client.js` (**L-4** "Layering: services don't open database connections. Take a DbHandle from the caller (withTransaction, F-13) instead.");
     - files under `apps/server/src/platform/http/**` may not import `**/*Repo.js` (**L-5** "Layering: platform/http doesn't import repositories. Go through a service instead.").

     ESLint prints its own sentence ("'pg' import is restricted from being used.") followed by the message.
  2. **Logging:** `pino` may be imported only under `apps/server/src/platform/observability/**`. `no-console` everywhere except `apps/server/src/main/**` and `tools/**`.
  3. **Money**, in `apps/server/src`, `packages/shared/src` and `apps/web/src`:
     - `no-restricted-globals: [{ name: "parseFloat", message: "parseFloat is forbidden; use the money helpers" }]` (message: A-27);
     - `no-restricted-properties` for `Number.parseFloat`, `globalThis.parseFloat` and `window.parseFloat` ("parseFloat is forbidden; use the money helpers") (A-15);
     - `no-restricted-syntax` with `CallExpression[callee.name='Number']` ("Number() conversion is forbidden; use the money helpers or Number.parseInt with a reason"), `UnaryExpression[operator='+']` ("Unary + conversion is forbidden; use the money helpers or Number.parseInt with a reason") (A-15) and `CallExpression[callee.name='bigint'] ObjectExpression > Property[key.name='mode'][value.value='number']`.

     A line may opt out with `// eslint-disable-next-line … -- <reason>` (the `eslint-comments/require-description` rule enforces the reason).
  4. **Web** (`apps/web/src/**`): `formatjs/enforce-default-message`, `formatjs/no-literal-string-in-jsx`, `formatjs/no-invalid-icu` (every descriptor's `defaultMessage` must parse as ICU; HLD D-37, A-18), with `settings: { formatjs: { additionalFunctionNames: ["t"] }, "jsx-a11y": { components: { Icon: "svg" }, attributes: { for: ["for"] } } }` (A-12, A-20, A-21); `budmon/message-id` (F-3b; `formatjs/enforce-id` is **not** enabled, A-12); `budmon/no-physical-tailwind` (F-2); `budmon/icon-from-registry` (F-3); and the **blocking** accessibility rules (D-39, HLD Q-1 (a)): `jsx-a11y/alt-text`, `jsx-a11y/control-has-associated-label` with options `{ labelAttributes: ["label"], ignoreElements: ["input", "select", "textarea"] }` (A-20), `jsx-a11y/label-has-associated-control` (default options; Solid's `for` through the `attributes` setting, A-21), `jsx-a11y/aria-props`, `jsx-a11y/aria-proptypes`, `jsx-a11y/aria-role`, `jsx-a11y/role-has-required-aria-props`, `jsx-a11y/tabindex-no-positive`. Every other `jsx-a11y` rule is `off` (D-39: report-only checks happen in Playwright).
- **Errors:** none (pure).
- **Calls:** F-2, F-3, F-3b.

#### F-2: `budmon/no-physical-tailwind` (ESLint rule)
- **File:** `packages/config/eslint/rules/no-physical-tailwind.js` · **Layer:** lint rule
- **Signature:** `export default { meta: { type: "problem", messages: { physical: string } }, create(context): RuleListener }`
- **Behaviour:**
  - Inspects string literals and template-literal quasis in JSX `class`/`classList` attributes and in calls to `cn(...)`/`clsx(...)`.
  - Splits them on whitespace and strips variant prefixes (`hover:`, `md:`, `rtl:`, …).
  - Reports each class matching `^-?(ml|mr|pl|pr|left|right|scroll-ml|scroll-mr|scroll-pl|scroll-pr)-` or `^(text-left|text-right|float-left|float-right|clear-left|clear-right)$` or `^(border-l|border-r|rounded-l|rounded-r|rounded-tl|rounded-tr|rounded-bl|rounded-br)(-|$)`.
  - Reports `space-x-*` and `divide-x-*` unless the same string also contains `rtl:space-x-reverse` (respectively `rtl:divide-x-reverse`).
  - Classes with an `rtl:` or `ltr:` variant aren't reported.
  - A literal on a line whose preceding line holds the comment `rtl-exempt: <non-empty reason>` isn't reported.
- **Errors:** report message `physical`: "Use the logical utility instead of '{{cls}}' (D-38)."
- **Calls:** none.

#### F-3: `budmon/icon-from-registry` (ESLint rule)
- **File:** `packages/config/eslint/rules/icon-from-registry.js` · **Layer:** lint rule
- **Signature:** as F-2, with `messages: { registry: string }`.
- **Behaviour** (A-10). F-1 enables the rule for `apps/web/src/**`. File paths are compared after replacing `\` with `/`, by suffix.
  - **Checked specifiers:** the `source` of every `ImportDeclaration` (including `import type`), of every `ExportNamedDeclaration` and `ExportAllDeclaration` that has one, and of every `ImportExpression` whose source is a string literal or a template literal without expressions. Other dynamic imports aren't checked.
  - **Relative vs package:** a specifier is *relative* when it starts with `./`, `../` or `/`; anything else is a *package specifier*. Relative specifiers are never treated as icon packages, so imports of `./ui/icons/registry.js`, `../icons/Icon.js` or any other relative module are allowed in every file.
  - **Package name:** strip a leading URL scheme matching `/^[a-z][a-z0-9+.-]*:/i` (for example `virtual:`, `node:`); then, if the rest starts with `@`, the package name is the first two `/`-separated segments, otherwise the first segment.
  - **Icon package:** the package name equals `lucide-solid` or `@tabler/icons-solidjs`, or matches `/icon/i`. Examples reported: `lucide-solid`, `lucide-solid/icons/home`, `@tabler/icons-solidjs`, `~icons/mdi/home`, `virtual:icons/mdi/home`, `unplugin-icons/x`, `@iconify/utils`. Not reported: `./ui/icons/registry.js`, `@budmon/shared`, `@budmon/shared/icons` (the package is `@budmon/shared`), `solid-js`.
  - Reports a checked package specifier that names an icon package, unless the file is `apps/web/src/ui/icons/registry.ts`.
  - Reports any checked specifier (relative or package) matching `/\.svg(\?.*)?$/` unless the file is under `apps/web/src/ui/icons/`.
  - Reports any JSX element named `svg` unless the file is under `apps/web/src/ui/icons/`.
- **Errors:** report message `registry`: "Use an icon from the registry (D-38 rule 6)." (one report per offending node).
- **Calls:** none.

#### F-3b: `budmon/message-id` (ESLint rule) (A-12)
- **File:** `packages/config/eslint/rules/message-id.js` · **Layer:** lint rule
- **Signature:** `export default { meta: { type: "problem", schema: [], messages: { missing: string; notLiteral: string; format: string } }, create(context): RuleListener }`
- **Behaviour:** F-1 enables it for `apps/web/src/**`.
  - **Message descriptors** are object literals in these positions: the first argument of a call whose callee is the identifier `t`, `defineMessage` or `formatMessage`, or a member expression whose property is `t` or `formatMessage`; and each property value that is an object literal inside the object-literal first argument of `defineMessages(...)`. Descriptors passed by reference (`t(m)`) are checked where they're written. Nothing else is checked.
  - For each descriptor, looks at its own non-computed property named `id`:
    - none, and the object has no spread element → `missing`. (An object with a spread and no `id` isn't reported.)
    - present, and its value isn't a string literal or a template literal without expressions → `notLiteral`.
    - a literal not matching `^[a-z][A-Za-z0-9_]*(\.[a-z][A-Za-z0-9_]*)+$` (case-sensitive) → `format`. Every ID in §8.1's catalog matches, for example `error.generic.read`, `error.rateLimited`, `validation.too_small`.
  - No autofix.
- **Errors:** report messages: `missing` "Give this message an explicit id (D-37)."; `notLiteral` "Message ids must be string literals so they can be extracted."; `format` "Message id '{{id}}' must be dot-separated segments starting with a lowercase letter, like 'error.generic.read'."
- **Calls:** none.

#### F-4: stylelint configuration
- **File:** `packages/config/stylelint/index.js` (exported by `@budmon/config` as `./stylelint`), used by the root `stylelint.config.js` and the root `lint:css` script (§2.2.2). All of it lands in **S-11a** (A-14). · **Layer:** config
- **Behaviour:** `plugins: ["stylelint-use-logical"]`, `rules: { "csstools/use-logical": ["always", { except: [] }] }`. A declaration preceded by the comment `/* rtl-exempt: <reason> */` is ignored (through `stylelint-disable-next-line csstools/use-logical` written by authors with the reason).

#### F-5: TypeScript and Prettier bases
- **Files:** `packages/config/tsconfig/{base,node,web}.json`, `packages/config/prettier/index.js`
- **Behaviour:**
  - `base`: `strict`, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`, `verbatimModuleSyntax`, `isolatedModules`, `noUncheckedSideEffectImports`, `moduleDetection: force`, `skipLibCheck`, `target: ES2024`, `declaration`, `sourceMap`.
  - `node`: `module`/`moduleResolution: nodenext`, `lib: ["ES2024"]`, `types: ["node"]`.
  - `web`: `module: preserve`, `moduleResolution: bundler`, `jsx: preserve`, `jsxImportSource: solid-js`, `lib: ["ES2024", "DOM", "DOM.Iterable"]`.
  - Prettier: `{ printWidth: 100, semi: true, singleQuote: false, trailingComma: "all" }`.

#### F-6: `checkMigrationFiles`
- **File:** `tools/ci/checkMigrationFiles.ts` (the only location; A-7) · **Layer:** CI script (S-0)
- **Signatures:**
  - `export interface CheckMigrationFilesInput { branch: string; changedFiles: readonly string[]; isHotfixMergeBack: boolean }`
  - `export function checkMigrationFiles(input: CheckMigrationFilesInput): { ok: true } | { ok: false; message: string }`
  - `export function parseCheckMigrationFilesArgs(argv: readonly string[]): { ok: true; branch: string; changedFilesPath: string; isHotfixMergeBack: boolean } | { ok: false; message: string }` (A-7)
  - `export function parseChangedFiles(text: string): string[]` (A-7)
  - `export function runCheckMigrationFilesCli(argv: readonly string[], deps: { readFile: (path: string) => string /* [inj] */; stdout: (line: string) => void /* [inj] */; stderr: (line: string) => void /* [inj] */ }): number` (A-7). Returns the exit code.
- **Behaviour, `checkMigrationFiles`:**
  - If `branch` matches `^(release|hotfix|infra)/` or `isHotfixMergeBack` is true → `{ ok: true }`.
  - Otherwise, any changed file whose path starts with `apps/server/drizzle/`, **except exactly `apps/server/drizzle/.gitkeep`** (the placeholder that keeps the empty folder in git; A-92), → `{ ok: false, message: "Migration files may only change on release/* and hotfix/* branches (D-12): <files>. Move these changes to a release/* or hotfix/* branch, or remove them from this pull request." }`, where `<files>` is the matching paths in input order joined with `", "` (A-29).
  - Otherwise → `{ ok: true }`.
- **Behaviour, `parseCheckMigrationFilesArgs`** (pure; argv is `process.argv.slice(2)`): reads tokens left to right.
  - `--branch <value>` and `--changed-files <value>` take the next token as their value. If there is no next token, or it is the empty string, or it starts with `--` → `{ ok: false, message: "Missing value for <flag>" }`.
  - `--hotfix-merge-back` is a flag with no value; present → `isHotfixMergeBack: true`, absent → `false`.
  - A flag given twice → `"Duplicate argument: <flag>"`. Any other token (including `--branch=x` forms and positional words) → `"Unknown argument: <token>"`. The first problem in argv order is returned.
  - After the loop: no `--branch` → `"Missing required argument: --branch"`; then no `--changed-files` → `"Missing required argument: --changed-files"`.
- **Behaviour, `parseChangedFiles`:** splits on `/\r?\n/` and drops empty strings; no other trimming; order and duplicates are kept. `""` → `[]`.
- **Behaviour, `runCheckMigrationFilesCli`:**
  1. Parse the arguments. On `ok: false`: `stderr("checkMigrationFiles: <message>")`, then `stderr("Usage: checkMigrationFiles.ts --branch <head ref> --changed-files <file> [--hotfix-merge-back]")`; return **64**.
  2. `deps.readFile(changedFilesPath)` (a relative path resolves against the process's working directory, which in `ci.yml` is `tools/ci/`; `ci.yml` passes an absolute path). If it throws: `stderr("checkMigrationFiles: cannot read <path>: <error message>")`; return **64**.
  3. `checkMigrationFiles({ branch, changedFiles: parseChangedFiles(text), isHotfixMergeBack })`. Not ok → `stderr(message)`; return **1**. Ok → `stdout("checkMigrationFiles: ok (1 changed file)")` when exactly one path was parsed, else `stdout("checkMigrationFiles: ok (<n> changed files)")` (A-29), `n` the number of parsed paths; return **0**.
- **Entry guard:** the module ends with `if (process.argv[1] !== undefined && import.meta.url === pathToFileURL(realpathSync(process.argv[1])).href) process.exitCode = runCheckMigrationFilesCli(process.argv.slice(2), { readFile: (p) => readFileSync(p, "utf8"), stdout: (l) => process.stdout.write(`${l}\n`), stderr: (l) => process.stderr.write(`${l}\n`) })`. Importing the module (tests) runs nothing.
- **CLI invocation (A-28):** from `tools/ci/`, `./node_modules/.bin/tsx checkMigrationFiles.ts --branch <head ref> --changed-files <file> [--hotfix-merge-back]`. `tsx` passes the script's exit code through; `pnpm --filter … exec` isn't used, because pnpm maps every non-zero exit to 1 and adds its own error banner. Every CI step that relies on a `tools/ci` CLI's exit code uses this direct form.
- **Wiring in `ci.yml`** (job `migrations`, created in S-0 and extended in S-14; A-7). The job has `if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'` and `permissions: contents: read`. Values reach the script only through `env`, never by `${{ }}` interpolation inside `run:` (a branch name is attacker-controlled text):
  ```yaml
  - uses: actions/checkout@<pinned SHA>
    with:
      fetch-depth: 0          # the base branch's history, for the three-dot diff
  # … pnpm/Node setup and `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` as in the `check` job …
  - name: List changed files
    env:
      BASE_REF: ${{ github.base_ref }}
    run: git -c core.quotePath=false diff --no-renames --name-only "origin/${BASE_REF}...HEAD" > "$RUNNER_TEMP/changed-files.txt"
  - name: Migration files only on release branches (F-6)
    env:
      HEAD_REF: ${{ github.head_ref }}
      MERGE_BACK: ${{ contains(github.event.pull_request.labels.*.name, 'hotfix-merge-back') || contains(github.event.pull_request.labels.*.name, 'infra-merge-back') }}
    working-directory: tools/ci   # A-28
    run: |
      args=(--branch "$HEAD_REF" --changed-files "$RUNNER_TEMP/changed-files.txt")
      if [ "$MERGE_BACK" = "true" ]; then args+=(--hotfix-merge-back); fi
      ./node_modules/.bin/tsx checkMigrationFiles.ts "${args[@]}"
  ```
  - `branch` = `github.head_ref` (the pull request's source branch, e.g. `release/v1.2.0`).
  - `changedFiles` = the three-dot diff against the pull request's base (`github.base_ref`), so only the pull request's own changes count. `HEAD` is the pull request's merge ref checked out by `actions/checkout`. `--no-renames` lists both sides of a rename, so moving a file out of `apps/server/drizzle/` also counts. `-c core.quotePath=false` writes non-ASCII paths verbatim instead of quoted, so they can't slip past the prefix check (A-16).
  - `isHotfixMergeBack` = the pull request carries the label `hotfix-merge-back` or `infra-merge-back`. The `labeled`/`unlabeled` triggers (§2.2 `ci.yml`) re-run the job when a label changes.
- **Errors:** none thrown; failures are return values and exit codes (0 ok, 1 check failed, 64 usage or unreadable file).
- **Calls:** `node:fs` (`readFileSync`, `realpathSync`) and `node:url` only in the entry guard; everything else is pure or goes through `deps`.

#### F-6b: `checkMergeBack`
- **File:** `tools/ci/checkMergeBack.ts` · **Layer:** CI script (S-14). Runs on pull requests labelled `hotfix-merge-back` or `infra-merge-back` (D-12).
- **Signature:** `export async function checkMergeBack(input: { serverDir: string; hotfixMigrationFiles: readonly string[] }, deps: { startPostgres: () => Promise<{ superuserUrl: string; stop(): Promise<void> }> /* [inj] */; pendingReport: typeof pendingSchemaReport /* F-181 */ }): Promise<{ ok: boolean; problems: string[] }>`
- **Behaviour:**
  1. On an empty database (F-14, then F-19 in migrate mode), every committed migration, now including the hotfix's, applies cleanly. A failure adds problem `"migrations don't apply: <file>"`.
  2. F-181's pending report for the merged head must contain **none** of the hotfix migration's statements: each `--> statement-breakpoint`-separated statement, whitespace-normalised, is searched for in the report's SQL. Each one found adds `"hotfix change still pending: <first 60 characters>"`.
  - `hotfixMigrationFiles` are the migration files the pull request adds (`git diff --name-only --diff-filter=A origin/main...HEAD -- apps/server/drizzle/*.sql`). For an `infra-merge-back`, the list must be empty (problem otherwise).
  - `ok = problems.length === 0`.
  - `infra/*` branches and the `infra-merge-back` label are used only from stage 1 (infrastructure-only releases, HLD D-29 rule 4). The rule is in F-6 and F-6b from day one so stage 1 changes no CI code; in stage 0 no such branch exists.

#### F-7: `checkEnvExample`
- **File:** `tools/ci/checkEnvExample.ts` · **Layer:** CI script (S-2)
- **Signature:** `export function checkEnvExample(schemaKeys: readonly string[], exampleText: string): { missingInExample: string[]; unknownInExample: string[] }`
- **Behaviour:** parses `KEY=value` lines (ignoring comments and blank lines) and compares them with `schemaKeys` (from F-10's `allConfigKeys()`). The CLI exits 1 if either list is non-empty.

#### F-8: `checkApiMinor`
- **File:** `tools/ci/checkApiMinor.ts` · **Layer:** CI script (S-4)
- **Signature:** `export function checkApiMinor(input: { baseOpenapi: object; headOpenapi: object }): { ok: boolean; message: string }`
- **Behaviour:** compares the two documents ignoring `info.version`. If they differ, `head.info.version` must be `1.<m>` with `m` > the base's minor, otherwise not ok ("The contract changed; bump API_MINOR in packages/contract/src/common/version.ts"). Identical documents with any version → ok.

#### F-9: `checkCatalogs`
- **File:** `tools/ci/checkCatalogs.ts` · **Layer:** CI script (S-11a)
- **Signature:** `export function checkCatalogs(input: { usedIds: ReadonlySet<string>; catalogs: Record<string, Record<string, string>> }): { missing: Record<string, string[]> }`
- **Behaviour:** for each shipped locale in `catalogs` (`en` at launch; pseudo-locales are generated, not shipped), lists the used IDs it lacks. The CLI extracts IDs with `@formatjs/cli extract --additional-function-names t` (no `--id-interpolation-pattern`: IDs are the explicit ones, A-12) over `apps/web/src/**/*.{ts,tsx}` (the same call sites F-1's `formatjs` settings and F-3b check, A-12) and fails if anything is missing.

### 4.2 Shared library `@budmon/shared` (S-1)

Pure functions with no I/O. Imported by the server and the web app. Android mirrors them in Kotlin (F-256) against the same test vectors.

#### F-300: currency codes and rationals
- **File:** `packages/shared/src/money/currency.ts`, `packages/shared/src/money/rational.ts`
- **Signatures:**
  ```ts
  export type CurrencyCode = string & { readonly __brand: "CurrencyCode" };
  export function asCurrencyCode(value: string): CurrencyCode;
  export interface Rational { readonly num: bigint; readonly den: bigint }
  export function rational(num: bigint, den: bigint): Rational;
  export function parseDecimal(text: string): Rational;
  export function roundHalfEven(value: Rational): bigint;
  export function toFixedDecimalString(value: Rational, scale: number): string;
  ```
- **Behaviour:**
  - `asCurrencyCode` returns the input if it matches `^[A-Z]{3}$`.
  - `rational` normalises to `den > 0n` and reduces by gcd. Every function that takes a `Rational` (`roundHalfEven`, `toFixedDecimalString`, F-301 `multiplyByRational`, F-303 `convertWithRates`) passes it through `rational(r.num, r.den)` first, so hand-built values are checked and normalised (A-44).
  - `parseDecimal` accepts `^[+-]?\d+(\.\d+)?([eE][+-]?\d{1,3})?$` and returns the exact rational ("0.1" → 1/10; "1.5e-3" → 3/2000).
  - `roundHalfEven` rounds to the nearest integer, ties to even (5/2 → 2, 7/2 → 4, −5/2 → −2).
  - `toFixedDecimalString(r, s)` rounds half-even to `s` decimals and prints without exponent, always with exactly `s` decimals (`s = 0` → no point).
- **Errors:** `asCurrencyCode` throws `TypeError("Invalid currency code")`; `rational` with `den = 0n` throws `RangeError("Zero denominator")`, and so does every function taking a hand-built `Rational` with `den = 0n` (A-44); `parseDecimal` throws `RangeError("Invalid decimal")`; `toFixedDecimalString` with `s` not an integer in 0..18 throws `RangeError`.

#### F-301: `Money` and arithmetic
- **File:** `packages/shared/src/money/money.ts`
- **Signatures:**
  ```ts
  export class Money {
    static of(minor: bigint, currency: CurrencyCode): Money;
    readonly minor: bigint;
    readonly currency: CurrencyCode;
    toString(): string;   // "[redacted]"
    toJSON(): string;     // "[redacted]"
    [Symbol.for("nodejs.util.inspect.custom")](): string; // "[redacted]"
  }
  export class CurrencyMismatchError extends Error {}   // name "CurrencyMismatchError"
  export function add(a: Money, b: Money): Money;
  export function subtract(a: Money, b: Money): Money;
  export function negate(a: Money): Money;
  export function sum(items: readonly Money[], currency: CurrencyCode): Money;
  export function compare(a: Money, b: Money): -1 | 0 | 1;
  export function isZero(a: Money): boolean;
  export function multiplyByRational(m: Money, r: Rational): Money;
  export function percentOf(m: Money, basisPoints: bigint): Money;
  export function ratio(part: Money, whole: Money): Rational;
  ```
- **Behaviour:** instances are frozen; `minor` and `currency` are non-enumerable read-only own properties, so `Object.keys` and spread expose nothing (A-47). `sum([])` returns zero in `currency`. `multiplyByRational` rounds once, half-even. `percentOf(m, bp)` is `multiplyByRational(m, bp/10000)`. `ratio` returns the exact `part.minor / whole.minor`.
- **Errors:**
  - `Money.of` with a non-bigint `minor` throws `TypeError`; with a `currency` not matching `^[A-Z]{3}$` it throws `TypeError("Invalid currency code")` (A-47).
  - `add`, `subtract`, `sum`, `compare` and `ratio` with different currencies throw `CurrencyMismatchError`, whose message names only the two codes.
  - `ratio` with a zero whole throws `RangeError`.

#### F-302: `allocate`
- **File:** `packages/shared/src/money/allocate.ts`
- **Signature:** `export function allocate(m: Money, weights: readonly bigint[]): Money[]`
- **Behaviour:** largest-remainder allocation. Each share is `floor(|m| × wᵢ / W)`. The leftover units go one each to the parts with the largest remainders, ties to the lower index. A negative `m` is allocated as `|m|` and every part negated. The result has `weights.length` parts that sum exactly to `m`.
- **Errors:** a weight that isn't a `bigint` throws `TypeError("Weights must be bigints")`, checked first (A-46). An empty `weights`, any `wᵢ < 0n`, or `W = 0n` throws `RangeError`.

#### F-303: `convertWithRates`
- **File:** `packages/shared/src/money/convert.ts`
- **Signature:** `export function convertWithRates(m: Money, from: { unitsPerUsd: Rational; minorUnits: number }, to: { currency: CurrencyCode; unitsPerUsd: Rational; minorUnits: number }): Money`
- **Behaviour:** returns `Money.of(roundHalfEven(m.minor × to.unitsPerUsd × 10^to.minorUnits / (from.unitsPerUsd × 10^from.minorUnits)), to.currency)`, exact in rationals, rounding once. If `m.currency === to.currency`, returns `m` unchanged.
- **Errors:** `from.minorUnits` or `to.minorUnits` not an integer in 0..4 throws `RangeError("Invalid minor units")`, before any arithmetic (A-46). A non-positive `unitsPerUsd` throws `RangeError`.

#### F-304: wire conversion
- **File:** `packages/shared/src/money/wire.ts`
- **Signatures:**
  ```ts
  export const MAX_WIRE_MINOR: 9007199254740991;
  export class MoneyRangeError extends Error {}
  export function toMoney(minor: number, currency: CurrencyCode): Money;
  export function toWire(m: Money): number;
  export function toWireMoney(m: Money): { amount: number; currency: string };
  export function fromWireMoney(w: { amount: number; currency: string }): Money;
  ```
- **Errors:**
  - `toMoney` with a non-safe-integer throws `MoneyRangeError`.
  - `toWire` and `toWireMoney` with `|minor| > 2^53 − 1` throw `MoneyRangeError`, whose message holds no amount.
  - `fromWireMoney` with an `amount` that isn't a safe integer (fractional, `NaN`, `±Infinity`, beyond ±(2^53 − 1), or not a number) throws `MoneyRangeError` with no amount in the message, checked before the code (A-36); then an invalid code throws `TypeError` (F-300).

#### F-305: `formatMoney`
- **File:** `packages/shared/src/money/format.ts`
- **Signature:** `export function formatMoney(m: Money, opts: { locale: string; minorUnits: number; currencyDisplay?: "code" | "symbol" | "narrowSymbol"; signDisplay?: "auto" | "never" | "always" | "exceptZero" }): string`
- **Behaviour:** builds the exact decimal string of `m.minor / 10^minorUnits` with exactly `minorUnits` decimals, then formats it with `new Intl.NumberFormat(locale, { style: "currency", currency: m.currency, currencyDisplay ?? "code", minimumFractionDigits: minorUnits, maximumFractionDigits: minorUnits, signDisplay ?? "auto" }).format(decimalString)`. The string-input overload keeps it exact. The default numbering system follows the locale.
- **Errors:** `minorUnits` outside 0..4 throws `RangeError`.

#### F-306: `canonicalJson`
- **File:** `packages/shared/src/json/canonical.ts`
- **Signature:** `export function canonicalJson(value: unknown): string`
- **Behaviour:** JSON with object keys sorted by UTF-16 code-unit order at every depth. Arrays keep their order. Properties whose value is `undefined` are omitted; `undefined` as the top-level value or as an array element (at any depth) throws `TypeError` (A-38). An object or array that is already an ancestor of the value being written throws `TypeError("Circular structure")`; the same object reached by two non-cyclic paths is written twice (A-45). Nesting deeper than 100 levels of objects and arrays throws `TypeError("Structure too deep")` (A-48). Error messages never include a key path or value. Objects from another realm are rejected as non-plain (A-48, no change). No whitespace.
- **Errors:** throws `TypeError` for `bigint`, non-finite numbers, functions, symbols, `Date`, `Map`, `Set` and class instances other than plain objects and arrays.

#### F-310: time
- **File:** `packages/shared/src/time/temporal.ts`, `packages/shared/src/time/clock.ts`
- **Signatures:**
  ```ts
  export { Temporal } from "@js-temporal/polyfill";   // temporal.ts, exactly this (A-34): namespace re-export, value and types; never globalThis.Temporal
  export interface Clock { now(): Temporal.Instant }
  export const systemClock: Clock;
  export interface MutableClock extends Clock { set(at: Temporal.Instant | string): void; advance(by: Temporal.DurationLike): void }
  export function fixedClock(at: Temporal.Instant | string): MutableClock;
  export function isValidTimeZone(zone: string): boolean;
  export function todayIn(clock: Clock, timeZone: string): Temporal.PlainDate;
  export function utcDateOf(instant: Temporal.Instant): Temporal.PlainDate;
  ```
- **Behaviour:**
  - `isValidTimeZone(zone)` (A-42) is true when `zone` is a non-empty string that `new Intl.DateTimeFormat("en", { timeZone: zone })` accepts, isn't `Etc/Unknown`, and doesn't start with `+` or `-` (offset strings such as `+02:00` are rejected). `todayIn` applies the same check.
  - `todayIn` is the calendar date of `clock.now()` in `timeZone`.
  - `utcDateOf` is the UTC calendar date.
  - `Temporal` is always the polyfill (`@js-temporal/polyfill` 0.5.1), even where the runtime has a native `globalThis.Temporal` (A-34). `src/index.ts` re-exports it, and callers write types as `Temporal.Instant`, `Temporal.PlainDate`.
- **Errors:** `todayIn` with an invalid zone throws `RangeError("Invalid time zone")`. `fixedClock` with an unparseable string throws `RangeError`.

#### F-311: IDs
- **File:** `packages/shared/src/ids/ids.ts`
- **Signatures:** `export interface IdGenerator { next(): string }`, `export const uuidv7Generator: IdGenerator`, `export function isUuid(value: string): boolean`
- **Behaviour:** `next()` returns a lower-case RFC 9562 UUIDv7 from `uuid`'s `v7()`. `isUuid` accepts exactly `^[0-9a-f]{8}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[1-8][0-9a-f]{3}-[89ab][0-9a-f]{3}-[0-9a-f]{12}$` (exported as `UUID_PATTERN`, A-169) (versions 1 to 8, RFC 9562 variant, lower case); the nil and max UUIDs are rejected (A-41).

#### F-312: locales and bidi
- **File:** `packages/shared/src/i18n/locale.ts`, `packages/shared/src/i18n/bidi.ts`
- **Signatures:** `export function resolveLocale(requested: string | null, supported: readonly string[], fallback?: string): string`, `export function directionOf(locale: string): "ltr" | "rtl"`, `export function isolate(text: string): string`
- **Behaviour:**
  - `resolveLocale` (A-39), case-insensitive, returning the supported tag's own spelling: (1) a supported tag equal to `requested`; (2) else, among supported tags whose language subtag (before the first `-`) equals `requested`'s language subtag, the bare-language tag if supported, otherwise the first in `supported` order; (3) else `fallback ?? "en"`. A null or empty `requested` goes to (3).
  - `directionOf`: `"rtl"` when the language subtag (before the first `-`, lower-cased) is `ar`, `he`, `fa`, `ur`, `ps`, `sd`, `yi` or `dv`; otherwise `"ltr"`. The pseudo-locale `ar-XB` is RTL through `ar`; no special case (A-40).
  - `isolate(t)` returns `"⁨" + t + "⁩"`.

#### F-313: test vectors
- **Files:** `packages/shared/test-vectors/{rounding,allocate,convert,wire,format}.json`
- **Format:** each file is `{ "version": 1, "cases": [ … ] }`, with numbers as strings for bigints:
  - `rounding`: `{ "num": "5", "den": "2", "expected": "2" }`;
  - `allocate`: `{ "minor": "100", "currency": "EGP", "weights": ["1","1","1"], "expected": ["34","33","33"] }`;
  - `convert`: `{ "minor": "12345", "from": { "currency": "EGP", "unitsPerUsd": "48.5", "minorUnits": 2 }, "to": { "currency": "JPY", "unitsPerUsd": "149.25", "minorUnits": 0 }, "expected": "380" }`;
  - `wire`: `{ "minor": "9007199254740992", "expected": "MoneyRangeError" }`;
  - `format`: `{ "minor": "123450", "currency": "EGP", "minorUnits": 2, "locale": "en-US", "expected": "EGP 1,234.50" }`.

  Format comparisons normalise U+00A0 and U+202F to U+0020 on both platforms. **Format cases (A-37):** locales `en-US` and `de-DE`, `currencyDisplay: "code"`, `signDisplay` `auto`; not tied to a CLDR/ICU version; a mismatch fails on both platforms (no skips) and is resolved by amendment. The test-architect writes the cases. The minimum set is listed in TP-1.10.
- **Behaviour:** read by the TypeScript suite (Vitest) and the Android suite (JUnit, through Gradle `sourceSets.test.resources.srcDir("../../packages/shared/test-vectors")`).

### 4.3 Configuration and database (S-2)

#### F-10: configuration schema
- **File:** `platform/config/schema.ts` · **Layer:** validator
- **Signatures:** `export type ProcessKind = "api" | "worker" | "migrate"`, `export type AppEnv = "development" | "test" | "rehearsal" | "production"`, `export function configSchemaFor(kind: ProcessKind): z.ZodType<Config>`, `export function allConfigKeys(): string[]`, and the `Config` type below.
- **Variables:** every `*_FILE` variable names a file whose content is the value, with one trailing newline trimmed. A relative path resolves against the process's working directory, which in development is always the repository root (A-73); in prod every `*_FILE` value must be absolute (problem "must be an absolute path"). **Secret-typed** values are wrapped in `Secret<string>` (F-32). "prod" means `APP_ENV` is `production` or `rehearsal`.

- **`Config` shape:**

  ```ts
  { kind; appEnv; logLevel; release;
    db: { host; port; name; user; password: Secret<string>; sslmode; sslRootCert?: Buffer; poolMax };
    worker?: { roles: ReadonlySet<"capture" | "general">; queue?: { user; password: Secret<string>; poolMax } };
    migrate?: { roleSecrets: Record<DbLoginRole, { verifier: string } | { password: Secret<string> }>; previousPassword?: Secret<string> /* A-71: DB_PASSWORD_PREVIOUS_FILE */ };
    api?: { port; host; publicOrigin: URL; googleOAuthRedirectOrigin: URL /* A-57: GOOGLE_OAUTH_REDIRECT_ORIGIN, else PUBLIC_ORIGIN's origin */; trustedProxy: string[]; clientVersions: { minAndroid; latestAndroid; minWeb; androidDownloadUrl?: URL };
            cursorKey: Secret<Buffer>; rateLimitKey: Secret<Buffer>; apiSecretsKeys: Secret<{ current: string; keys: Map<string, Buffer> }>; devObjectsKey?: Secret<Buffer>;
            googleSignIn?: { clientId: string; clientSecret: Secret<string>; androidClientIds: string[]; callbackOrigin: URL; appOrigins: URL[] };
            recoveryCodeKeys: Secret<{ current: string; keys: Map<string, Buffer> }> };
    email?: { smtpUrl: URL; smtpTransport: { security: "implicit_tls" | "starttls" | "none"; host: string; port: number; user?: string } /* A-57 */;
              smtpPassword?: Secret<string>; from: string; publicOrigin: URL };   // worker with general (A-2)
    capture?: { publicKeyPem: string; keyVersion: string; kms: { provider: "gcp"; credentials: Secret<object> } | { provider: "local"; privateKeyPem: Secret<string> };
                oauth?: { clientId: string; clientSecret: Secret<string>; redirectOrigin: URL /* A-57 */ }; mailboxHmacKey: Secret<Buffer> };
    sealing?: { publicKeyPem: string; keyVersion: string };
    fx?: { provider: "live"; primaryAppId: Secret<string>; primaryBaseUrl: URL; fallbackBaseUrl: string; fallbackMirrorUrl: string } | { provider: "fixed" };
    objectStore?: { kind: "fs"; root: string } | { kind: "s3"; endpoint: URL; region: string; buckets: { exports: string; erasureLog: string }; accessKeyId: Secret<string>; secretAccessKey: Secret<string> };
    otlpEndpoint?: URL; otlpHeaders?: Secret<Record<string, string>> /* A-138 */; sentryDsn?: string }
  ```
- **Behaviour:** pure schema. `allConfigKeys()` returns every variable name in the table, sorted (including `DEV_SUPERUSER_URL`, A-59). `smtpTransport` (A-57): `smtps` → `implicit_tls`, default port 465; `smtp` → `starttls`, default port 587, except `none` for the plaintext hosts allowed above.

#### F-11: `loadConfig`
- **File:** `platform/config/loadConfig.ts` · **Layer:** validator
- **Signature:** `export function loadConfig(kind: ProcessKind, env: Readonly<Record<string, string | undefined>>, readFile: (path: string) => Buffer [inj]): Config`. Also `export class ConfigError extends Error { readonly problems: readonly { variable: string; rule: string }[] }`.
- **Behaviour:**
  1. Reads each `*_FILE` variable that's set through `readFile`.
  2. Parses with `configSchemaFor(kind)`.
  3. Applies the production rules in F-10.
  4. Returns a deep-frozen `Config`.
- **Errors:** throws `ConfigError` with one problem per failing variable. `rule` is a fixed phrase from the schema ("required", "must be one of: …", "must be an https URL", "file not readable", "must be base64 of 32 bytes", "not allowed in production", "placeholder not filled" for a file, or a non-file variable, whose content after trimming one trailing newline is exactly `__FILL_ME__`). **Values never appear** in `message` or `problems`. Every entry point catches `ConfigError` (F-90 to F-93): it prints `Configuration invalid:` followed by one `  - <VARIABLE>: <rule>` line per problem to stderr, exits with code 78, and opens no port or connection.
- **Calls:** F-10, F-32 (`Secret`).

#### F-12: `createDatabase`
- **File:** `platform/db/client.ts` · **Layer:** infrastructure
- **Signature:** `export function createDatabase(cfg: Config["db"], opts: { applicationName: string; onError?: (err: Error) => void }): Database`
- **Behaviour:**
  - Creates a `pg.Pool` with `max = cfg.poolMax`, `application_name = applicationName`, `statement_timeout = 30000`, `idle_in_transaction_session_timeout = 60000` and `ssl = cfg.sslmode === "verify-full" ? { ca: cfg.sslRootCert, rejectUnauthorized: true, servername: cfg.host } : false`.
  - `handle.db` is `drizzle({ client: pool, schema, casing: "snake_case" })`.
  - `handle.executeSql` runs `pool.query(text, values)`. `handle.inTransaction = false`.
  - Pool `error` events go to `opts.onError` (sanitised by the caller).
  - `close()` ends the pool.
- **Errors:** none at construction (connections are lazy).

#### F-13: `withTransaction` and `createCommitTracker`
- **File:** `platform/db/transaction.ts` · **Layer:** infrastructure
- **Signatures:**
  ```ts
  export function withTransaction<T>(database: Database, fn: (tx: DbHandle) => Promise<T>,
    opts?: { isolation?: "read committed" | "serializable"; tracker?: CommitTracker;
             sleep?: (ms: number) => Promise<void> /* [inj] */; random?: () => number /* [inj] */ }): Promise<T>;
  export function createCommitTracker(): CommitTracker;
  ```
- **Behaviour:**
  1. Takes a client from the pool and runs `BEGIN ISOLATION LEVEL <isolation ?? READ COMMITTED>`.
  2. Builds a `DbHandle` bound to that client (`inTransaction: true`) and calls `fn`.
  3. On resolve: `COMMIT`, then `tracker?.markCommitted()`, then returns the value.
  4. On reject: `ROLLBACK` (its own errors are ignored), releases the client, and rethrows.
  - If the error, or the error raised by `COMMIT`, has SQLSTATE `40001` or `40P01`, the whole `fn` is retried up to **3** times (4 attempts in total) after `sleep(10 + floor(random() × 40))` ms.
  - Nested calls aren't supported: if `fn` calls `withTransaction` with the same database, the inner call runs in a separate transaction. Services must not do that; review checks it.
- **Errors:** rethrows the last error after 4 attempts, or any non-retryable error unchanged.

#### F-14: `bootstrapCluster`
- **File:** `platform/db/clusterBootstrap.ts`, SQL in `platform/db/sql/cluster-bootstrap.sql` · **Layer:** infrastructure
- **Signature:** `export async function bootstrapCluster(superuser: import("pg").Client, input: { databaseName: string; migrator: { verifier: string } | { password: string } }): Promise<void>`
- **Behaviour:** idempotent. Creates role `budmon_migrator` (LOGIN CREATEROLE NOINHERIT) if missing and sets its password from the verifier or password. Creates database `databaseName` owned by `budmon_migrator` if missing. In that database it runs `ALTER SCHEMA public OWNER TO budmon_migrator`, `REVOKE CREATE ON SCHEMA public FROM PUBLIC` and `REVOKE ALL ON DATABASE <name> FROM PUBLIC`, `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS amcheck`, `GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION bt_index_check(regclass, boolean) TO budmon_migrator` and `GRANT pg_read_all_data TO budmon_migrator WITH INHERIT TRUE` (for F-150; an explicit `INHERIT TRUE` is required because `budmon_migrator` is NOINHERIT and, since Postgres 16, a grant's inherit option defaults to the member's attribute), and `GRANT pg_monitor TO budmon_migrator WITH ADMIN TRUE, INHERIT FALSE, SET FALSE` (so F-15 can grant it on). The migrator's password is applied with `ALTER ROLE budmon_migrator PASSWORD <literal>`, the literal quoted client-side with `pg`'s `escapeLiteral` and run with tracing suppressed (F-15 rule 3).
- **Used by:** the test global setup (with the Testcontainers superuser) and the Postgres image's first-setup script (F-170), which runs the same statements from `sql/cluster-bootstrap.sql` through `psql`. **The file (A-75):** `-v dbname=<name>`; the password from the environment (`\getenv migrator_password BUDMON_MIGRATOR_PASSWORD`, never in argv), applied as `ALTER ROLE budmon_migrator PASSWORD :'migrator_password'` (psql quotes it); `\connect :"dbname"`; an unset variable stops the script before any change. Node's F-14 doesn't run the file; it issues the same statements with `escapeLiteral`/`escapeIdentifier`.
- **Errors:** rethrows driver errors.

#### F-15: `applyRolesAndPrivileges`
- **File:** `platform/db/roles.ts` · **Layer:** infrastructure (schema step 1)
- **Signature:** `export type DbLoginRole = "budmon_app" | "budmon_capture" | "budmon_queue" | "budmon_monitor" | "budmon_migrator"; export async function applyRolesAndPrivileges(migrator: DbHandle, secrets: Record<DbLoginRole, { verifier: string } | { password: string }>, appEnv: AppEnv, logger: Logger): Promise<void>` (`logger`: A-51; logs `info("role_password_set", { role })` once per role)
- **Behaviour:** as `budmon_migrator`, idempotently:
  0. **Attribute check (A-77), before any statement:** every existing login role must have exactly LOGIN, NOSUPERUSER, NOCREATEDB, NOCREATEROLE, NOINHERIT, NOREPLICATION, NOBYPASSRLS (`budmon_migrator`: CREATEROLE instead of NOCREATEROLE), read from `pg_roles`; otherwise `SchemaStepError("role_attributes_unexpected", role)` and nothing is altered.
  1. Creates the roles in §3.3 that are missing (`CREATE ROLE … LOGIN NOINHERIT`).
  2. Runs `GRANT budmon_queue TO budmon_migrator WITH SET TRUE, INHERIT FALSE` and `GRANT pg_monitor TO budmon_monitor WITH INHERIT TRUE` (explicit, because the member is NOINHERIT; see F-14).
  3. Sets every role's password with `ALTER ROLE <identifier> PASSWORD <literal>`. **Utility statements take no bind parameters**, so the statement text is built client-side with `pg`'s `escapeIdentifier` and `escapeLiteral`. For the verifier form, the literal is the `SCRAM-SHA-256$…` string, which Postgres stores as is.
     - **No leak of the value:** these statements run inside `context.with(suppressTracing(context.active()), …)` (`@opentelemetry/core`), so the `pg` instrumentation creates no span and `db.query.text` never carries them. They're never logged (only `event: "role_password_set"` with `role`). Postgres runs with `pg_stat_statements.track_utility = off` (F-170, and the test container's command line), so `pg_stat_statements` never stores them; `log_statement = none` keeps them out of server logs. Validation runs **before any statement**: a verifier must match `^SCRAM-SHA-256\$\d+:[A-Za-z0-9+/=]+\$[A-Za-z0-9+/=]+:[A-Za-z0-9+/=]+$`, and in prod `password` forms are rejected.
  4. Grants `CONNECT` on the database to all login roles, and `USAGE` on schema `public` to `budmon_app`, `budmon_capture` and `budmon_monitor`.
- **Errors:** throws `SchemaStepError("invalid_verifier", role)` or `SchemaStepError("password_form_in_production", role)` (plain `Error` subclasses, CLI exit 3). Rethrows driver errors.

#### F-16: `tableGrants` and `applyTableGrants`
- **File:** `platform/db/grants.ts` · **Layer:** infrastructure (schema step 4)
- **Signatures:**
  ```ts
  export type Privilege = "SELECT" | "INSERT" | "UPDATE" | "DELETE";
  export interface TableGrant { app: readonly Privilege[]; capture: readonly Privilege[]; credential: boolean }
  export const tableGrants: Readonly<Record<string, TableGrant>>; // keyed by SQL table name
  export async function applyTableGrants(migrator: DbHandle, grants?: Readonly<Record<string, TableGrant>>): Promise<void>;
  ```
- **Behaviour:**
  1. For every table in `public`, revokes all privileges from `budmon_app` and `budmon_capture`.
  2. Grants exactly the listed privileges.
  3. Grants `USAGE, SELECT` on the table's sequences when `INSERT` is granted.
  4. `budmon_monitor` gets no table privileges (`pg_monitor` covers statistics).
  5. If schema `drizzle` exists: `GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA drizzle TO budmon_app` and `GRANT SELECT ON drizzle.__drizzle_migrations TO budmon_app` (F-57's readiness check, A-130); no other role gets anything there.

  Modules add their tables to `tableGrants` in their own slices, through an import of `<module>Grants` merged in `grants.ts`.
- **Errors:**
  - A table present in `public` but missing from `grants` throws `SchemaStepError("table_without_grants", table)`.
  - A table listed in `grants` but absent from `public` throws `SchemaStepError("table_missing", table)` (exit 3; A-179).
  - An entry with `credential: true` and a non-empty `capture` list throws `SchemaStepError("credential_table_granted_to_capture", table)` (HLD D-19 platform rule).

#### F-17: `pushSchemaOntoEmpty`
- **File:** `platform/db/schemaPush.ts` (development and test only; never imported by `main/migrate.ts`) · **Layer:** infrastructure (schema step 2, push mode)
- **Signature:** `export async function pushSchemaOntoEmpty(migrator: DbHandle): Promise<{ statements: number }>`
- **Behaviour:**
  1. Checks that `public` holds no tables. Then computes SQL with `drizzle-kit/api`'s `generateMigration(generateDrizzleJson({}), generateDrizzleJson(schema, undefined, "snake_case"))`. With an empty "from" there are no rename ambiguities and therefore no prompt.
  2. Executes the statements in one transaction, then `ALTER TABLE "rate_limit_counters" SET UNLOGGED`.
- **Errors:** a non-empty `public` throws `PushTargetNotEmptyError` (message lists up to 5 table names).

#### F-18: `applyCommittedMigrations`
- **File:** `platform/db/migrations.ts` · **Layer:** infrastructure (schema step 2, migrate mode)
- **Signature:** `export async function applyCommittedMigrations(database: Database, migrationsFolder: string): Promise<{ applied: number; verified: number }>`, and `export function readJournal(migrationsFolder: string): { tag: string; when: number; hash: string }[]`
- **Behaviour:**
  1. `readJournal` reads `meta/_journal.json`; `hash` is the SHA-256 hex of each `<tag>.sql` (Drizzle's algorithm). A missing journal (or folder) means **zero migrations**: `readJournal` returns `[]`. A journal file that exists must parse as JSON with an `entries` array whose every entry has `tag` matching `^[0-9]{4}_[a-z0-9_]+$`, `when` a non-negative safe integer, `idx` equal to its position, and an existing `<tag>.sql` (A-160), else `JournalInvalidError` ("drizzle journal is invalid", no content; `migrate` exit 5, A-150). **After the journal is validated, before any migration work (A-146, A-162):** `CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS drizzle` and `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS drizzle.__drizzle_migrations (id serial PRIMARY KEY, hash text NOT NULL, created_at bigint)`. With no entries (missing or empty journal), `applyCommittedMigrations` then skips Drizzle's `migrate` (which needs the file), returning `{ applied: 0, verified: 0 }`, or `UnknownMigrationError` if the migrations table holds rows (A-80).
  2. If `drizzle.__drizzle_migrations` exists, every row's `(hash, created_at)` must match a journal entry's `(hash, when)`.
  3. Then runs `migrate(drizzle(pool), { migrationsFolder })` (all pending migrations in one transaction).
  4. Returns the count newly applied and the count verified.
- **Errors:** a recorded migration missing from the image throws `UnknownMigrationError` (CLI exit 4). Migration SQL errors are rethrown (CLI exit 5).

#### F-19: `runSchemaStep`
- **File:** `platform/db/schemaStep.ts` · **Layer:** service
- **Delivery (A-49):** S-2 delivers the input without `jobRegistry`, steps 1, 2, 4 (without the `pgboss` default privileges) and 5, and the report `{ migrationsApplied, pushedStatements, currenciesUpserted }`. S-6 adds `jobRegistry`, steps 3 and 6, the `pgboss` privileges and the report's three queue fields. The full shape:
- **Signature:** `export async function runSchemaStep(input: { mode: "migrate" | "push"; database: Database /* as budmon_migrator */; migrationsFolder: string; roleSecrets: Record<DbLoginRole, { verifier: string } | { password: string }>; appEnv: AppEnv; jobRegistry: JobRegistry /* S-6 */; referenceData: ReferenceData; logger: Logger }): Promise<SchemaStepReport>`, where `SchemaStepReport = { migrationsApplied: number; pushedStatements: number; queueSchema: "installed" | "upgraded" | "current"; currenciesUpserted: number; queuesCreated: number; queuesUpdated: number }` (`queueSchema`, `queuesCreated`, `queuesUpdated` from S-6). Push mode only works on an empty database (F-17); re-running the step on an existing database uses `migrate` mode (A-50).
- **Behaviour, in order:**
  1. F-15.
  2. `push` → F-17, loaded only in push mode through `await import(pushModule)` with the specifier held in a variable, so the server bundle never contains `drizzle-kit` (A-68); `migrate` → F-18.
  3. F-74 (queue schema, as `SET ROLE budmon_queue`).
  2b. **Fresh database (A-179, A-204):** in migrate mode, when the journal is empty, no migration is recorded and none of `tableGrants`' tables exists, steps 3 and 6 still run, F-16 runs only its step 5 (A-130's `drizzle` grant), and step 5 (reference data) is skipped (`currenciesUpserted: 0`). A pushed database runs every step.
  4. F-16, plus `pgboss` default privileges (F-74).
  5. F-21.
  6. F-75 (queue sync).

  Each step is logged with `event: "schema_step"`, `step` and `durationMs`. The step stops at the first failure; earlier steps aren't undone (each is idempotent).
- **Errors:** propagates the step's error.

#### F-20: `resetDevelopmentDatabase`
- **File:** `platform/db/reset.ts`; CLI `main/dbReset.ts` (`pnpm db:reset`) · **Layer:** service
- **Signature:** `export async function resetDevelopmentDatabase(input: { appEnv: AppEnv; superuserUrl: string; databaseName: string; migratorPassword: string; roleSecrets: …; seed: boolean; allowNonLocalHost?: boolean /* A-79, default false; tests only */ }, deps: { runSchemaStep: typeof runSchemaStep [inj]; seed: () => Promise<void> [inj] /* A-54: F-94 supplies the closure */ }): Promise<void>`
- **Behaviour:**
  1. Guard (before any connection): `appEnv` must be `development` or `test`, and the host of `superuserUrl` must be `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `::1` or `host.docker.internal`, unless `input.allowNonLocalHost === true` (A-79: an explicit input set only by TP-2.16 (b); F-20 never reads the environment, so no variable can widen the guard; the `appEnv` check and the effective-host refusals below apply either way).
     **Precedence (A-96):** `app_env`, then `unparseable_url` (including multi-host authorities and an empty host, which the parser rejects), then on a parsed URL `host_parameter`, `host_list`, `socket_path`, `non_local_host`.
     **Effective host (A-74):** `superuserUrl` is parsed with `pg-connection-string`'s `parse`; any `host` or `hostaddr` query parameter, a host list (a comma), or a socket path (host starting with `/`) is refused, and the allowlist applies to the parsed host.
  2. Terminates connections to `databaseName`, drops it (`WITH (FORCE)`), then F-14, then F-19 with `mode: "push"`, then the seeders when `seed` is true.
  3. `superuserUrl` comes from `DEV_SUPERUSER_URL` (development only; `.env.example`: `postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres`). The dev roles' passwords come from `.data/dev-secrets/roles.json`, which `pnpm dev` creates with random values on first run.
- **Errors:** a failed guard throws `ResetRefusedError` (exit 2) with `reason` (A-84) one of `app_env`, `non_local_host`, `host_parameter`, `host_list`, `socket_path`, `unparseable_url`, and message `db:reset only runs against a local development or test database: <phrase>`, the phrase fixed per reason (`APP_ENV is <appEnv>` for a known `AppEnv`, else `APP_ENV is not a known environment` (A-93), `the host isn't local`, `the URL sets a host parameter`, `the URL lists several hosts`, `the URL is a socket path`, `the URL can't be parsed`); never the URL, host, user or password. `seedDevelopmentDatabase` uses the `db:seed` form. Otherwise rethrows.
- **`seedDevelopmentDatabase`** (A-14, `pnpm db:seed`), same file:
  - **Signature:** `export async function seedDevelopmentDatabase(input: { appEnv: AppEnv; superuserUrl: string; allowNonLocalHost?: boolean /* A-79 */ }, deps: { seed: () => Promise<void> [inj] }): Promise<void>`
  - **Behaviour:** applies exactly the guard of step 1 above (before any connection); then calls `deps.seed()` once. It never drops, creates or migrates anything; the database must already exist (created by `pnpm dev` or `db:reset`). F-94 supplies `deps.seed` as building a worker container from the development configuration, running F-23's `runSeeders` (every registered seeder, each idempotent) and closing the container.
  - **Errors:** a failed guard throws `ResetRefusedError` with message "db:seed only runs against a local development or test database" (exit 2), and `deps.seed` isn't called. Errors from `deps.seed` are rethrown (exit 1 through F-94).

#### F-21: `loadReferenceData`
- **File:** `platform/db/referenceData.ts` · **Layer:** repo
- **Signature:** `export interface ReferenceData { currencies: readonly { code: string; name: string; minorUnits: number; active: boolean }[] }; export async function loadReferenceData(migrator: DbHandle, data: ReferenceData): Promise<{ upserted: number }>`
- **Behaviour:** the caller imports `iso4217.json` with `import … with { type: "json" }` (inlined by F-24; never read by path, A-43). In one transaction: inserts missing currencies, and updates `name`, `is_active` and `updated_at` for existing ones where they differ. Never deletes. A row whose `minor_units` differs from the file is an error.
- **Errors:** throws `SchemaStepError("minor_units_changed", code)` and rolls back.

#### F-22: `main/dev.ts` (`pnpm dev`)
- **Behaviour:**
  0. **Environment (A-63):** `ensureDevEnv(repoRoot, process.env, …)`: creates `.env` from `.env.example` if it's missing (never overwrites), parses it, and merges it under `process.env`. The result supplies `DEV_SUPERUSER_URL` and is the environment of every process started below.
  1. `docker compose -p budmon-dev -f infra/compose.yaml up -d` (the project name HLD D-28/D-29 use, distinct from the laptop's `budmon-main` and `budmon-capture`; one development stack per Docker daemon, A-88); then `waitForPostgres(DEV_SUPERUSER_URL, …)` (A-86): from the host, over **TCP**, a `pg` client with `connectionTimeoutMillis: 2000` runs `SELECT 1` every 500 ms for up to 60 s (the image's init server listens only on the socket, so the first TCP success is the real server); an authentication error (SQLSTATE `28P01` or `28000`) is rethrown at once, not retried (A-97); timeout → `PostgresNotReadyError` (`reason "postgres_not_ready"`, message "Postgres didn't become ready within 60 s", A-97). Signature: `export async function waitForPostgres(url: string, deps: { connect(url: string, timeoutMs: number): Promise<void>; sleep(ms: number): Promise<void>; now(): number }, opts?: { timeoutMs?: number; intervalMs?: number }): Promise<void>`.
  2. Creates `.data/dev-secrets/*` with random values if missing, plus an RSA-3072 key pair for `capture_*`, and `migrator_password` holding `budmon_migrator`'s password from `roles.json` (for `db:migrate`, A-83).
  3. If database `budmon` doesn't exist, runs F-20 with `seed: true`.
  4. Starts, with `cwd` = the repository root (A-73), `tsx watch --tsconfig apps/server/tsconfig.json --import ./apps/server/src/main/instrument.ts apps/server/src/main/api.ts` (A-147) and the same for `apps/server/src/main/worker.ts` (`WORKER_ROLES=capture,general`) and `vite` (web) with prefixed output. Ctrl-C stops all three.
  - **Vite dev server** (`apps/web/vite.config.ts`, `server`): `host: "127.0.0.1"`, `port: 5173`, `strictPort: true`, and `proxy` for `/api` and `/health` to `http://127.0.0.1:3000` (`changeOrigin: false`). On the laptop, WSL2's localhost forwarding makes it reachable from Windows at `localhost:5173`, and so from the Android emulator at `http://10.0.2.2:5173/`, which is the debug builds' API base URL (F-264). The development stack is the only one debug builds can reach.
- **Errors:** Docker not running → prints "Docker isn't running" and exits 1. `main` catches every other error and prints `pnpm dev failed: <errorClass>[ <errorCode>][ (<reason>)]` (F-26, A-81), with no stack trace, and exits 1 (A-86).

#### F-23: seed framework
- **File:** `platform/db/seed.ts` · **Layer:** service
- **Signature:** `export interface Seeder { name: string; run(c: WorkerContainer): Promise<void> }; export const seeders: Seeder[]; export async function runSeeders(c: WorkerContainer, list?: readonly Seeder[]): Promise<void>`
- **Behaviour:** runs seeders sequentially. Each must be idempotent. The platform registers `platform.fx-rates` (§3.4).

#### F-24: `buildServer` (A-43)
- **File:** `apps/server/scripts/build.ts` (package script `build` = `tsx scripts/build.ts`; run by S-15's Dockerfile as `pnpm --filter @budmon/server build`) · **Layer:** build
- **Signature:** `export async function buildServer(opts?: { outdir?: string; serverDir?: string }): Promise<{ entryPoints: string[]; external: string[] }>` (defaults: `outdir` `<serverDir>/dist/main`, `serverDir` the directory of `apps/server/package.json`); the module runs it when executed directly (entry guard as in F-6) and exits 1 on a build error.
- **Behaviour:**
  1. Deletes `<outdir>`.
  2. `external` = every key of `apps/server/package.json` `dependencies`, each also as `<name>/*` (subpaths). `@budmon/*` packages are never in `dependencies`, so they're bundled, with any dependency only they use.
  3. `esbuild.build({ entryPoints: <every src/main/*.ts except the development-only dev.ts, dbReset.ts and devMigrate.ts (A-83)> (A-56: S-2 has api, worker, migrate; S-4 adds instrument (A-147); S-6 adds cli, healthcheck), bundle: true, platform: "node", target: "node24", format: "esm", splitting: true, outdir, chunkNames: "chunks/[name]-[hash]", sourcemap: "linked", external, logLevel: "warning" })`; JSON imports are inlined.
  4. Returns the entry points and the external list.
- **Errors:** esbuild errors reject (the CLI prints them and exits 1). A file under `src/` importing a package that isn't in `dependencies` and isn't a workspace package fails the build with esbuild's "could not resolve" error.

#### F-25: `serverRoot` (A-43)
- **File:** `platform/config/serverRoot.ts`
- **Signature:** `export function serverRoot(fromUrl?: string): string` (`fromUrl` defaults to `import.meta.url`; tests pass their own)
- **Behaviour:** walks up from the directory of `fileURLToPath(fromUrl)` to the first directory holding a `package.json` whose `name` is `@budmon/server`, and returns that directory, cached **per start directory** (a `Map`; a not-found result isn't cached) (A-60). It's the same in source (`apps/server/src/…`, under tsx and Vitest) and in the bundle (`<root>/dist/main/…` in the image, where `package.json` stays at the root). Every runtime path is built from it: the migrations folder is `join(serverRoot(), "drizzle")` (F-18, F-92) and module assets are `join(serverRoot(), "src", <module>, "assets", <file>)` in source and the image alike (the Dockerfile copies `src/*/assets/` to the same relative paths).
- **Errors:** no such `package.json` up to the filesystem root → `Error("server root not found")`.

#### F-26: `describeFailure` (A-81)
- **File:** `platform/observability/describeFailure.ts` (S-2)
- **Signature:** `export function describeFailure(err: unknown): { errorClass: string; errorCode?: string; reason?: string }`
- **Behaviour:** `errorClass` = the constructor name of an `Error` (`"NonError"` otherwise). `errorCode` = `SchemaStepError.code`, else a Postgres SQLSTATE (`err.code` matching `^[0-9A-Z]{5}$`), else a Node system code (`^E[A-Z0-9_]{1,30}$`). `reason` = `SchemaStepError.subject`, `ResetRefusedError.reason` or `PostgresNotReadyError.reason` (A-97). Any value not matching F-30's `token` rule is left out. The message, `cause`, stack and every other property are never read into the result.
- **`runCommand` (A-89):** `export async function runCommand(command: string, fn: () => Promise<number | void>, stderr: (line: string) => void): Promise<number>` returns `fn`'s exit code (0 for none); if `fn` throws, it writes one line `<command> failed: <errorClass>[ <errorCode>][ (<reason>)]` and returns 1, never a stack. `dev.ts` (`"pnpm dev"`) and `devMigrate.ts` (`"db:migrate"`) run through it; `runDbResetCli` uses it for unexpected errors, while `ResetRefusedError` prints its own A-84 message and exits 2 (A-91).
- **Used by:** F-90, F-91, F-92 (`startup_failed` log fields) and the development commands' one-line stderr messages (`<command> failed: <errorClass>[ <errorCode>][ (<reason>)]`): `dbReset.ts`, `devMigrate.ts`, `dev.ts`.
- **Errors:** none.

### 4.4 Observability and privacy layers (S-3)

#### F-30: safe log fields
- **File:** `platform/observability/safeFields.ts` · **Layer:** validator
- **Signatures:**
  ```ts
  export type FieldKind = "id" | "token" | "route" | "count" | "duration" | "bool" | "errorKey" | "date";
  export const SAFE_LOG_FIELDS: Readonly<Record<string, FieldKind>>;
  export type SafeFieldName = keyof typeof SAFE_LOG_FIELDS;
  export type SafeFields = Partial<Record<SafeFieldName, string | number | boolean>>;
  export function sanitizeFields(fields: Readonly<Record<string, unknown>>): { fields: Record<string, string | number | boolean>; dropped: number };
  ```
- **The closed set** (modules add entries only through an amendment to this file):

  | Kind | Fields |
  | ---- | ------ |
  | `id` | `requestId`, `traceId`, `spanId`, `userId`, `entityId`, `jobId` |
  | `token` | `event`, `step`, `jobName`, `queue`, `method`, `statusClass`, `errorClass`, `errorCode`, `clientKind`, `module`, `outcome`, `provider`, `currency`, `service`, `release`, `role`, `limiter`, `signal`, `reason` |
  | `route` | `route` |
  | `count` | `status`, `count`, `attempt`, `clientVersion`, `dropped`, `inserted`, `rejected` |
  | `duration` | `durationMs` |
  | `bool` | `retryable`, `replayed`, `provisional` |
  | `errorKey` | `errorKey` |
  | `date` | `rateDate` |
- **Value rules per kind:**
  - `id` and `token`: `^[A-Za-z0-9_.:-]{1,64}$`;
  - `route`: `^/[A-Za-z0-9_./:{}-]{0,200}$`;
  - `count`: a non-negative safe integer;
  - `duration`: a finite number ≥ 0;
  - `bool`: a boolean;
  - `errorKey`: `^[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]{1,63}$`;
  - `date`: `^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}$`.
- **Behaviour:** unknown keys are removed. Known keys with an invalid value are replaced by the string `"[invalid]"`. A field whose read throws (a getter) is removed (A-133). `dropped` counts all three.
- **`route` rule addition (A-136):** a value with a segment that is UUID-shaped or contains 5 or more consecutive digits is invalid (templates use `{id}`/`:id`).
- **`token`-kind values are code constants** (A-116): string literal unions, enum values, registered job or queue names; never derived from user data or external text. The rule checks only the shape.

#### F-31: `createLogger`
- **File:** `platform/observability/logger.ts` · **Layer:** infrastructure
- **Signature:**
  ```ts
  export interface Logger {
    debug(event: string, fields?: SafeFields): void;
    info(event: string, fields?: SafeFields): void;
    warn(event: string, fields?: SafeFields, err?: unknown): void;
    error(event: string, fields?: SafeFields, err?: unknown): void;
    child(bindings: SafeFields): Logger;
  }
  export function createLogger(opts: { service: string; release: string; level: "debug" | "info" | "warn" | "error"; appEnv?: AppEnv /* A-139 */;
    destination?: import("pino").DestinationStream /* [inj] */; stream?: "stdout" | "stderr" /* A-109, default stdout */; onDrop?: (n: number) => void }): Logger;
  ```
- **Behaviour:**
  - Writes one JSON line per call through pino, to `destination` if given, else to `stream` (A-109: `migrate`, `cli` and the development `db:*` commands use `"stderr"`, so their stdout holds only their output). Fixed keys: `level` (string), `time` (ISO 8601 UTC), `service`, `release`, `event`.
  - Then the sanitised fields (F-30), then `err` (F-33's `SanitizedError`) when given. The fixed keys win: a field named `level`, `time`, `service`, `release` or `event` is dropped and counted (A-113).
  - An `event` not matching the `token` rule is written as `"invalid_event"` and counted as dropped.
  - `onDrop(n)` is called with F-30's `dropped` when > 0, and the line gets `dropped: n`. In `development` and `test` (`appEnv`) the line also gets `droppedKeys`: the names of the dropped or replaced fields that match `^[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9_]{0,63}$` (A-139); never in `rehearsal` or `production`. A field whose getter throws is dropped and counted; the line is still written (A-133).
  - pino is configured with `base: null`, no `hostname`/`pid`, and serializers that never print other properties.
- **Errors:** none (never throws on bad input).

#### F-32: `Secret`
- **File:** `platform/observability/redaction.ts`
- **Signature:** `export class Secret<T> { static of<T>(value: T): Secret<T>; reveal(): T; toString(): "[redacted]"; toJSON(): "[redacted]"; [Symbol.for("nodejs.util.inspect.custom")](): "[redacted]" }`
- **Behaviour:** the value lives in a private field (`#value`). `JSON.stringify`, template literals, `util.inspect` and `console.log` of a `Secret`, or of an object containing one, show `[redacted]`.

#### F-33: `sanitizeError`
- **File:** `platform/observability/sanitize.ts`
- **Signature:** `export interface SanitizedError { class: string; key?: string; code?: string; status?: number; reason?: string; frames: string[] }; export function sanitizeError(err: unknown): SanitizedError`
- **Behaviour:**
  - **`class`:** `err.constructor.name` for `Error` instances; `"NonError"` otherwise.
  - **`key`:** for `BudmonError`.
  - **`code`:** a Postgres error's `code` (SQLSTATE `^[0-9A-Z]{5}$`), or a Node system error's `code` (`^E[A-Z0-9_]{1,30}$`).
  - **`status`:** an integer 100..599, from `err.status`, `err.response.status` or `err.statusCode`.
  - **`reason`:** for Google client errors (`GaxiosError`, or any object with `response.data.error`), the first of `response.data.error.errors[0].reason` and `response.data.error.status` that matches the `token` rule.
  - **`frames`** (A-110): only the `err.stack` lines **after** the header `String(err)`; a stack that doesn't start with `String(err)` plus a newline, or a throwing `toString`, gives `[]`. Each line must match V8's frame grammar; `function` must match `^(?:(?:async|new) )?[A-Za-z_$][A-Za-z0-9_$.<>\[\]]{0,99}$` (or be absent) and the reduced `filename` `^[A-Za-z0-9_@./<>:-]{1,200}$` (reduction: strip `file://`; keep from `node_modules/`, or relative to the repository/image root, or `node:<name>`; else `<unknown>`; reduction is idempotent, so already-reduced names are unchanged, A-119). Failing lines are dropped. Frames are rebuilt as `at <function> (<filename>:<line>:<col>)`, at most 30. **`buildErrorEvent(err)`** (same file) returns `{ type, value: key ?? code ?? class, stacktrace: { frames } }` from these parts, for F-34.
  - Every property read is guarded (A-132): a read that throws counts as absent (`class` → `"NonError"` when `constructor`/`name` throws; `frames: []` when `stack` throws); `sanitizeError`, `buildErrorEvent` and F-26 never throw.
  - `message`, `detail`, `where`, `parameters`, `config`, `cause`, `response.data` and every other property are **never** copied. `AggregateError` and `cause` chains contribute nothing beyond the top-level class.
- **Errors:** none.

#### F-34: `initSentry` and `ErrorReporter`
- **File:** `platform/observability/sentry.ts`, `platform/observability/errorReporter.ts`
- **Signatures:**
  ```ts
  export interface ErrorContext { requestId?: string; userId?: string; route?: string; jobName?: string; errorKey?: string }
  export interface ErrorReporter { report(err: unknown, ctx: ErrorContext): void; flush(timeoutMs: number): Promise<void> }
  export function initSentry(cfg: { dsn?: string; environment: AppEnv; release: string; service: string; httpsProxy?: string }): ErrorReporter;
  export function createMemoryErrorReporter(): ErrorReporter & { readonly events: readonly Record<string, unknown>[] }; // tests and the canary suite
  ```
- **Behaviour:**
  - Without a DSN, `report` is a no-op.
  - A DSN not matching F-10's pattern for `environment` (the local http form only in development and test, A-141) → the no-op reporter, `Sentry.init` never called (A-131).
  - With a DSN: `Sentry.init({ debug: false /* A-131: Sentry's console stays silent */, dsn, environment, release, dataCollection: <every flag off> /* A-104: Sentry 11 */, enableOpenTelemetrySetup: false /* A-104 */, includeLocalVariables: false, maxBreadcrumbs: 20, defaultIntegrations: false, integrations: [linkedErrorsIntegration({ limit: 1 }), onUncaughtExceptionIntegration({ exitEvenIfOtherHandlersAreRegistered: false }), onUnhandledRejectionIntegration({ mode: "none" }) /* A-118 */], beforeSend: scrubSentryEvent, beforeBreadcrumb: scrubBreadcrumb, transportOptions: { proxy: httpsProxy } })`. No request-data, console, HTTP-body or local-variables integrations.
  - `report` never throws (A-132): every read of the error is guarded; a throwing property counts as absent.
  - `report` builds the event from F-33 only: `exception.values[0] = buildErrorEvent(err)` (A-110). Tags `route`, `job`, `error_key`, `request_id` (A-122), `error_code` and `http_status` (from F-33's `code` and `status`, A-137); `user: { id: userId }`, each validated first (A-112): `route` through `stripQuery` and F-30's `route` rule, `jobName` F-70's job-name format, `errorKey` `errorKey`, `userId` F-311 `isUuid`, `requestId` `^[0-9a-f]{32}$` (A-121); a failing value is dropped.
  - `beforeSend(event, hint)` (A-110): when `hint.originalException` exists, `event.exception.values = [buildErrorEvent(hint.originalException)]`; otherwise each value keeps only `type`. Then F-35. It never passes the original error object to Sentry.
- **Calls:** F-33, F-35.

#### F-35: `scrubSentryEvent` and `scrubBreadcrumb`
- **File:** `platform/observability/sentry.ts`
- **Signatures:** `export function scrubSentryEvent(event: Record<string, unknown>): Record<string, unknown> | null`, `export function scrubBreadcrumb(b: Record<string, unknown>): Record<string, unknown> | null`
- **Behaviour:**
  - `scrubSentryEvent` returns a new object with only:
    - `event_id`, `timestamp`, `platform`, `level`, `release`, `environment`;
    - `exception.values[].{type, value, stacktrace.frames[].{filename, function, lineno, colno, in_app}}`;
    - `tags` restricted to `route`, `job`, `client_kind`, `error_key`, `request_id` (A-122; `^[0-9a-f]{32}$`), `error_code` (`^[0-9A-Z]{5}$` or `^E[A-Z0-9_]{1,30}$`) and `http_status` (an integer 100..599) (A-137), each value checked with F-30's rules (`route` after `stripQuery`; `token`; `errorKey`) and dropped on failure (A-112);
    - `user.id`, dropped unless it passes F-311 `isUuid` (A-112, A-121); `tags.job` uses F-70's job-name format (A-121);
    - `contexts.trace.{trace_id, span_id}`;
    - `breadcrumbs`: Sentry 11's array (also accepted as `{ values: [] }`), each passed through `scrubBreadcrumb`, written as an array (A-134; none are generated on the server today).

    Every remaining stack frame must pass A-110's `function` and `filename` patterns or is dropped. Every `exception.values[].value` is replaced by that entry's `type`, unless it matches the API error-key format `^[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]{1,63}$` (A-101; the `token` rule isn't a safe filter for exception text).
  - `scrubBreadcrumb` keeps only `category ∈ {"http", "navigation"}`; a kept breadcrumb has exactly `category`, `timestamp`, `type`, `level` and `data.{url, method, status_code}` (each only when present), with `data.url` reduced to scheme, host and path (F-37) (A-103). Anything else returns `null`.

#### F-36: `startTelemetry`
- **File:** `platform/observability/otel.ts`
- **Signature:** `export function startTelemetry(cfg: { endpoint?: URL; headers?: Secret<Record<string, string>> /* A-138, A-142 */; service: string; release: string; environment: AppEnv }, deps: { onDrop: (signal: "traces" | "metrics", kind: "expected" | "unexpected", n: number) => void; traceExporter?: SpanExporter /* [inj] */; metricReader?: MetricReader /* [inj] */ }): { metrics: Metrics; shutdown(): Promise<void> }`
- **Behaviour:**
  - Starts the NodeSDK with resource attributes `service.name`, `service.version` and `deployment.environment.name`.
  - Instrumentations: `http` (incoming `ignoreIncomingRequestHook` for `/health/*`; `headersToSpanAttributes` empty), `undici`, `pg` (`enhancedDatabaseReporting: false`, `requireParentSpan: true`) and `@fastify/otel` (`registerOnInitialization: true`, A-163; its spans are INTERNAL children of the http SERVER span). pg-boss's built-in tracing is enabled with F-77 in S-6 (A-107).
  - Traces go through `AllowlistSpanExporter(OTLPTraceExporter)` (F-40). Exporter URLs are `new URL("v1/traces", base)` and `new URL("v1/metrics", base)`, `base` = the endpoint with a trailing `/`; both exporters send `config.otlpHeaders` (A-138). Metrics use `PeriodicExportingMetricReader` every 60 s.
  - **Metric attribute allowlist for every instrument**, including those created by instrumentations (which bypass F-41): the `MeterProvider` gets the view `{ instrumentName: "*", attributesProcessors: [createAllowListAttributesProcessor(METRIC_ATTRIBUTE_ALLOWLIST)] }`. `METRIC_ATTRIBUTE_ALLOWLIST` = `METRIC_LABELS` ∪ { `http.request.method`, `http.response.status_code`, `http.route`, `url.scheme`, `server.address`, `server.port`, `network.protocol.version`, `db.system.name`, `db.namespace`, `db.operation.name`, `error.type` }. Instrumentation histograms for client requests keep `server.address` (a bounded set of hosts) and never `url.full`. `http.server.*` instruments must not carry `server.address` or `server.port` (they'd come from the client's `Host`); the pinned `instrumentation-http` doesn't add them, and no extra View is used (two Views would double-count), TP-3.11 asserts it (A-177, A-181).
  - Configuration comes only from `cfg` and `deps`: `resourceDetectors: []`, no environment-derived exporters or readers, so `OTEL_*` variables have no effect (A-106). Without an `endpoint` and without an injected `traceExporter`/`metricReader`, no MeterProvider is registered and instruments are no-ops; nothing leaves the process (A-106).
  - The W3C trace-context propagator is enabled.
- **Calls:** F-40, F-41.

#### F-37: `stripQuery`
- **File:** `platform/observability/sanitize.ts`
- **Signature:** `export function stripQuery(url: string): string`
- **Behaviour:** returns `scheme://host[:port]/path` without query or fragment. An unparseable input returns `"[invalid-url]"`.

#### F-38: request log hook
- **File:** `platform/observability/requestLog.ts`
- **Signature:** `export function registerRequestLog(app: RequestLogHost, deps: { logger: Logger; metrics: PlatformMetrics }): void`, where `RequestLogHost` is the structural `{ addHook(name: "onResponse", hook: (request, reply: { statusCode: number; elapsedTime: number }) => Promise<void> | void): unknown }` that a `FastifyInstance` satisfies (A-105). Delivered in S-3, wired and tested (TP-4.17) in S-4.
- **Behaviour:**
  - On `onResponse`, logs `info("http_request", { method, route, status, statusClass, durationMs, clientKind, clientVersion, requestId, userId })`. `route` is the matched route template: oRPC's matched OpenAPI path (from `request.orpcRoute` set by F-55), Fastify's `routeOptions.url` for non-oRPC routes, or `"/unmatched"` (A-111).
  - Increments `http_server_requests_total` and records `http_server_duration_seconds`. The log line and both metrics are written by the exported `recordRequest(deps, fields)`, which `frameworkErrors` also calls (A-183).
  - `/health/live` and `/health/ready` are logged at `debug`.

#### F-39: `startupState` and `installFatalHandlers` (A-118, A-120)
- **File:** `platform/observability/fatal.ts`
- **Signatures:**
  ```ts
  export interface FatalState { logger: Logger; reporter: ErrorReporter }
  export function startupState(service: string, env: Readonly<Record<string, string | undefined>>, opts?: { destination?: import("pino").DestinationStream /* [inj] */ }): FatalState;
  export function installFatalHandlers(state: FatalState, exit?: (code: number) => void /* [inj], default process.exit */, target?: Pick<NodeJS.EventEmitter, "on"> /* [inj], default process */): void;
  ```
- **Behaviour:**
  - `startupState`: a logger for `service` at `info`, `release` = `env.BUDMON_RELEASE` when it matches F-10's release pattern, else `"dev"` (A-115); a reporter whose `report` and `flush` do nothing.
  - `installFatalHandlers`: on `target`'s `unhandledRejection` and `uncaughtException`, logs `state.logger.error("unhandled_rejection" | "uncaught_exception", describeFailure(e), e)`, awaits `state.reporter.flush(2000)` (a throwing flush is ignored), then calls `exit(1)`. It reads `state` at event time, so F-90/F-91 replace `state.logger` and `state.reporter` once configuration is loaded.
- **Errors:** none.

#### F-40: `AllowlistSpanExporter`
- **File:** `platform/observability/otel.ts`
- **Signature:** `export const EXPECTED_DROPPED_SPAN_ATTRIBUTES: readonly string[]; export class AllowlistSpanExporter implements SpanExporter { constructor(inner: SpanExporter, allowlist: ReadonlySet<string>, onDrop: (kind: "expected" | "unexpected", n: number) => void); export(spans: ReadableSpan[], cb): void; shutdown(): Promise<void> }`
- **Behaviour:**
  - For each span, copies only allowlisted attribute keys and drops all span **events** (exception events carry messages). Span **links** keep their `context` and lose their `attributes` (A-114; each counted like a dropped attribute). **`db.query.text` is masked** (A-135): single-quoted (including `E'…'`), dollar-quoted strings and numeric literals outside identifiers and `$n` placeholders become `?`; SQL comments (`--…`, `/*…*/`) are removed; double-quoted identifiers are kept; an unparseable text (unterminated quote or comment) is dropped (`unexpected`) (A-142). **Span names** must match `^[A-Za-z0-9_.:/{}* -]{1,120}$` (A-164 adds `*`), else become `"span"` (one `unexpected` drop). Spans from scope `@fastify/otel` are first renamed to the part of their name before the first ` - ` (the hook name), with no drop counted (A-164). The span status message is set to `""`. `url.path` is never exported (A-176); `server.address`/`server.port` are removed from SERVER spans (A-177); `budmon.route` (the oRPC route template) must pass F-30's `route` rule.
  - Each removed attribute is classified:
    - `expected` if its key equals an entry of `EXPECTED_DROPPED_SPAN_ATTRIBUTES`, or starts with an entry ending in `.`;
    - otherwise `unexpected`.

    Removed span events are `expected` when named `exception`, otherwise `unexpected`. Sums are passed to `onDrop` per kind.
  - **`EXPECTED_DROPPED_SPAN_ATTRIBUTES`** (what the pinned `http`, `undici`, `pg`, `@fastify/otel` and pg-boss instrumentations emit beyond the allowlist, under both current and older semantic conventions): `url.full`, `url.query`, `url.original`, `url.path` (A-176), `user_agent.original`, `client.address`, `client.port`, `network.peer.address`, `network.peer.port`, `network.local.address`, `network.local.port`, `network.transport`, `network.type`, `http.request.body.size`, `http.response.body.size`, `http.request.resend_count`, `http.request.header.`, `http.response.header.`, `http.url`, `http.target`, `http.host`, `http.scheme`, `http.flavor`, `http.user_agent`, `http.method`, `http.status_code`, `http.client_ip`, `net.`, `db.user`, `db.connection_string`, `db.system`, `db.name`, `db.statement`, `db.postgresql.`, `messaging.`, `fastify.`, `hook.`, `service.name`, `error.type`, `exception.`. S-4's test (TP-4.21) asserts that a request through the real instrumented stack produces no `unexpected` drops; an instrumentation upgrade that adds an attribute therefore fails CI rather than alerting in production.
  - Span names are left as is, because the instrumentations use route templates and SQL operation names.
  - **Allowlist:** `http.request.method`, `http.response.status_code`, `http.route`, `budmon.route` (A-176), `url.scheme`, `server.address` and `server.port` (CLIENT spans only, A-177), `network.protocol.version`, `db.system.name`, `db.namespace`, `db.operation.name`, `db.collection.name`, `db.query.text` (parameterised by `pg`, D-24 rule 6), `rpc.system`, `rpc.method`, and `budmon.job.name`, `budmon.queue`, `budmon.error.key`, `budmon.outcome`, `budmon.client.kind`.

#### F-41: `createMetrics`
- **File:** `platform/observability/metrics.ts`
- **Signatures:**
  ```ts
  export const METRIC_LABELS: ReadonlySet<string>; // service, environment, http_route, method, status_class, client_kind, queue, job_state,
                                                   // module, error_key, source_kind, connection_status, age_bucket, signal, drop_kind, limiter, provider, reason (A-178)
  export interface Metrics {
    counter(name: string, opts: { description: string; labels: readonly string[] }): { add(n: number, labels: Record<string, string>): void };
    histogram(name: string, opts: { description: string; labels: readonly string[]; buckets: readonly [number, number, number, number, number, number] }): { record(v: number, labels: Record<string, string>): void };
    observableGauge(name: string, opts: { description: string; labels: readonly string[] }, observe: () => readonly { value: number; labels: Record<string, string> }[]): void;
  }
  export function createMetrics(meter: import("@opentelemetry/api").Meter, onDrop: (n: number) => void): Metrics;
  ```
- **Behaviour:** instrument names must match `^[a-z][a-z0-9_]{2,63}$`. At record time, labels not declared for the instrument are removed, and values not matching their rule are replaced by `"invalid"`: `http_route` uses F-30's `route` rule, every other label the `token` rule (A-111). Each removal or replacement calls `onDrop(1)`.
- **Errors:** registration with a label outside `METRIC_LABELS`, a label listed twice (A-138), or an invalid name, throws `Error("metric definition invalid: <name>")` (a programming error, caught by unit tests).

#### F-42: `registerPlatformMetrics`
- **A-178:** adds counter `http_client_errors_total` with label `reason` (`bad_request`, `timeout`, `headers_too_large`); `reason` is added to `METRIC_LABELS`.
- **File:** `platform/observability/metrics.ts`
- **Signature:** `export function registerPlatformMetrics(m: Metrics): PlatformMetrics`
- **Behaviour:** registers and returns typed handles for:

  | Metric | Labels |
  | ------ | ------ |
  | `http_server_requests_total` | `http_route`, `method`, `status_class`, `client_kind` |
  | `http_server_duration_seconds` (buckets 0.05, 0.1, 0.3, 0.8, 2, 5) | `http_route`, `method` |
  | `jobs_processed_total` | `queue`, `job_state` (`completed\|failed`) |
  | `job_duration_seconds` (buckets 0.1, 1, 5, 30, 120, 600) | `queue` |
  | `jobs_dead_lettered_total` | `queue` |
  | `queue_depth` (observable) | `queue` |
  | `worker_heartbeat_timestamp_seconds` (observable) | `service` |
  | `telemetry_attributes_dropped_total` | `signal` (`logs\|traces\|metrics`), `drop_kind` (`expected\|unexpected`); F-31's and F-41's own drops are always `unexpected` |
  | `rate_limited_total` | `limiter` |
  | `idempotent_replays_total` | (none) |
  | `client_update_required_total` | `client_kind` |
  | `kms_errors_total` | (none) |
  | `fx_rates_fetched_total`, `fx_rates_rejected_total` | `provider` |
  | `fx_backfill_missing_total` | (none) |
  | `fx_last_day_timestamp_seconds` (observable) | (none) |
  | `reconcile_corrections_total` | `module` |

### 4.5 Error model and the API server (S-4)

#### F-50: `BudmonError`
- **File:** `platform/errors/BudmonError.ts` · **Layer:** domain
- **Signature:** `export class BudmonError<D extends Record<string, unknown> | undefined = undefined> extends Error { readonly key: string; readonly status: number; readonly details: D; constructor(key: string, status: number, message?: string, details?: D) }`
- **Behaviour:** keeps the existing class's shape (CR §4.1); `toSerializable()` and the Express handler are removed. `message` defaults to `key`. `name` is the subclass name.
- **Errors:** a `key` not matching `^[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]{1,63}$`, or a `status` outside 400..599, throws `TypeError`.

#### F-51: platform errors
- **File:** `platform/errors/platformErrors.ts`
- **Signature:** one class per row of §6 with these constructors: `ValidationFailedError(issues: readonly Issue[])`, `UnauthenticatedError()`, `ForbiddenError()`, `NotFoundError()`, `ConflictError(details?: Record<string, string>)`, `IdempotencyKeyReusedError()`, `PayloadTooLargeError()`, `RateLimitedError(retryAfterSeconds: number)`, `ClientUpdateRequiredError(minimumVersion: number)`, `ServiceUnavailableError(outcome: Outcome)`. Types: `export interface Issue { path: (string | number)[]; code: string; message: string }`, `export type Outcome = "not_applied" | "unknown"`.
- **Behaviour:** each sets the key, status and fixed developer message from §6.

#### F-52: `mapError` and `createErrorInterceptor`
- **File:** `platform/errors/interceptor.ts`
- **Signatures:**
  ```ts
  export function mapError(err: unknown, state: { committed: boolean }, declared?: Readonly<Record<string, { message?: string; data?: unknown } | undefined>> /* A-170 */): { error: ORPCError<string, unknown>; report: boolean };
  export function createErrorInterceptor(deps: { reporter: ErrorReporter; logger: Logger }): Interceptor; // per call: errorMap? from the matched procedure (A-170) // oRPC server interceptor, registered on the OpenAPIHandler
  ```
- **Behaviour of `mapError`** (`outcome = state.committed ? "unknown" : "not_applied"`):
  1. `BudmonError` → `new ORPCError(key, { status, message, data: details, defined: true })`, `report: false`.
  2. An oRPC input validation failure (`ORPCError` with code `BAD_REQUEST` whose `cause` is `ValidationError`) → `VALIDATION_FAILED` 400 with `data.issues` built from `cause.issues`: `path` from the issue path, `code` from the zod issue `code`, `message` = the zod default message for that code **without** input values (fixed per code: `invalid_type` "Invalid type", `too_small` "Too small", `too_big` "Too big", `invalid_format` "Invalid format", `invalid_value` "Invalid value", `unrecognized_keys` "Unknown field", `custom` "Invalid value", others "Invalid value"). The `cause` is not attached. `report: false`.
  3. An oRPC output validation failure (`INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR` with a `ValidationError` cause) → `INTERNAL` 500 with `data: { outcome }`, `report: true` (reported with issue paths and codes only).
  3b. (A-149, A-166) An `ORPCError` with `defined: true` (declared in the contract), other than `INTERNAL` and `SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE` (which fall through to rules 5 and 6): returned with its own code and status, the **declared** message (§6's for platform keys; the contract's declared `message`, else the key) never the thrown one, and its data **only** when the declared error has a data schema (otherwise none); `report: false`.
  4. An undefined `ORPCError` with code `NOT_FOUND` (unmatched route) → `NOT_FOUND` 404, `report: false`. Other undefined oRPC built-in errors (`METHOD_NOT_SUPPORTED`, …) → `NOT_FOUND` 404. This includes `HEAD` on `/api/v1/*`, which isn't supported (A-175).
  5b. (A-172) A defined `SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE` → `SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE` 503, §6's message, `data: { outcome }`, `report: true`.
  5. A Postgres error with SQLSTATE `57P01`, `57P02`, `57P03`, `53300`, or a Node error `ECONNREFUSED`/`ETIMEDOUT`/`ECONNRESET` from `pg` → `SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE` 503 with `data: { outcome }`, `report: true`.
  6. Anything else → `INTERNAL` 500 with message "Internal error" and `data: { outcome }`, `report: true`.
- **Behaviour of the interceptor:** wraps every procedure call. On error, calls `mapError` with the request's `commitTracker`. If `report`, calls `reporter.report(err, { requestId, userId, route })` and logs `error("request_failed", { errorKey, requestId, route })` with the error. Rethrows the mapped `ORPCError`. For `RATE_LIMITED` it also sets `Retry-After: <retryAfterSeconds>` on the response.
- **Calls:** F-34, F-31, F-33.

#### F-53: procedure bases
- **File:** `platform/http/procedures.ts` · **Layer:** router
- **Signatures:**
  ```ts
  export const base: ImplementerInternal<typeof contract, RequestContext, RequestContext>; // implement(contract).$context<RequestContext>()
  export const publicProcedure: typeof base;
  export const authedProcedure: …;  // base.use(requireAuth): ctx.principal: Principal (non-null)
  export const ownerProcedure: …;   // authed + requireOwner
  export const PUBLIC_PROCEDURES: ReadonlySet<string>; // dotted contract paths; platform: { "meta.clientConfig" }
  export const requireAuth: Middleware;   // A-123: principal null → UnauthenticatedError; context.principal non-null after
  export const requireOwner: Middleware;  // A-123: used after requireAuth; !isOwner → ForbiddenError
  export function procedureBases<C extends AnyContractRouter>(contract: C): { base; publicProcedure; authedProcedure; ownerProcedure }; // A-123; the constants above = procedureBases(contract)
  ```
- **Behaviour:** `requireAuth` throws `UnauthenticatedError` when `principal` is null. `requireOwner` throws `ForbiddenError` when `!principal.isOwner`. Modules implement procedures only from these bases. Procedures on `publicProcedure` must be listed in `PUBLIC_PROCEDURES`; modules add entries in their own slices.

#### F-54: `AuthHook`
- **File:** `platform/http/context.ts`
- **Signature:** `export interface AuthHook { authenticate(req: { headers: Readonly<Record<string, string | undefined>>; cookies: Readonly<Record<string, string>> }): Promise<Principal | null> }; export const noAuthHook: AuthHook`
- **Behaviour:** `noAuthHook.authenticate` resolves `null`. `identity` provides the real hook through the container (F-96) and owns its errors. A hook that throws is treated as an unexpected error (F-52 rule 6).

#### F-55: `createApiServer`
- **File:** `platform/http/server.ts` · **Layer:** router (composition)
- **Signature:** `export async function createApiServer(c: ApiContainer, opts?: { contract?: AnyContractRouter; router?: Router<any, RequestContext>; journal?: readonly { hash: string; when: number }[] /* A-125, default readJournal(join(serverRoot(), "drizzle")) */ }): Promise<import("fastify").FastifyInstance>`. `opts.contract` defaults to F-346's `contract` and `opts.router` to F-59's `appRouter` (A-26); tests pass test-only contracts and routers (S-4 AC 1).
- **Behaviour,** in registration order:
  1. `Fastify({ logger: false, /* no disableRequestLogging: no logger, so no request logging (A-144) */ trustProxy: c.config.api.trustedProxy.length ? c.config.api.trustedProxy : false, bodyLimit: 102400, connectionTimeout: 30000, requestTimeout: 30000, return503OnClosing: true, genReqId: () => <request id per RequestContext> })`.
  2. F-61 (headers), F-62 (body handling) (both delivered in S-4, A-124), the coarse in-memory rate limit (F-65's global part; registered only when `c.rateLimiter` is present, from S-5, A-124), `@fastify/cookie`.
  3. The `onRequest` hook builds the request context: parses `X-Budmon-Client` (F-56), creates the commit tracker (F-13), calls `authHook.authenticate` only when `request.routeOptions.url` starts with `/api/v1/` (others, including unmatched requests, get `principal: null`, A-154, A-168), and binds a child logger with `requestId`.
  4. F-57 health routes (`GET /health/live`, `GET /health/ready`).
  2b. **Framework and client errors (A-178):** `frameworkErrors` answers pre-routing errors with 400 `VALIDATION_FAILED` (`invalid_url` "Request URL is not valid." for `FST_ERR_BAD_URL`, else `invalid_request` "Request is not valid."), F-61's headers via `applySecurityHeaders(reply)`, `X-Request-Id`, and records the request through F-38's `recordRequest` (log line and both metrics) with route `/unmatched` (A-183); nothing echoed. Client-error `reason` values: `headers_too_large` (431), `timeout` (408), `bad_request` (400); `ECONNRESET` and destroyed sockets are ignored and not counted (A-184). `clientErrorHandler` writes fixed bodiless `400`/`408`/`431` responses with `Connection: close`, and increments `http_client_errors_total{reason}`.
  4b. **Module routes (A-26):** calls each `c.moduleRoutes[i](app)` in array order (identity registers `GET /api/v1/auth/google/callback` this way). They're plain Fastify routes on the same instance, so steps 2 and 3, F-38 and step 8 apply to them; they're outside oRPC, so F-52's interceptor and F-56's middleware don't, and each route answers its own errors. A static path wins over step 5's `/api/v1/*` wildcard in Fastify's router whatever the order; registering them first keeps the order explicit. A registration that throws (for example a duplicate route) rejects `createApiServer`.
  5. `OpenAPIHandler` (with a Budmon interceptor that runs oRPC's `JsonSchemaCoercer` (zod converter) on the input only for `GET` requests (A-173, A-175; `HEAD` isn't supported on `/api/v1`), coercing their query and path strings to the declared integer/boolean/date types before validation; bodies are never coerced, A-148, A-165) from `@orpc/openapi/fastify` for the implemented router (`platform` plus modules' routers), with `prefix: "/api/v1"`, plugins `ResponseHeadersPlugin` and `RequestHeadersPlugin`, interceptors F-52, F-56's middleware, and the `X-Budmon-API-Version` setter. The route interceptor sets A-186's RPC route only when the active context has HTTP RPC metadata (A-199). It's mounted with a Fastify catch-all `app.all("/api/v1/*", (request, reply) => handler.handle(request, reply, { prefix: "/api/v1", context }))`, using `@orpc/openapi/fastify`'s handler, which takes the **Fastify** request and reply (not `raw`). **Body handling:** Fastify parses the body first with F-62's JSON parser, body limit and errors, and the adapter reads the already-parsed `request.body`. oRPC never reads the raw stream, so malformed and oversized bodies are answered by F-62 before oRPC runs. TP-4.19 verifies this in S-4's spike. If the adapter turns out to read the raw stream instead, the fallback (an amendment) is `@orpc/openapi/node`'s handler with a pass-through content-type parser for `/api/v1/*` and F-62's checks moved into an oRPC interceptor.
  6. In development only, F-145's dev objects route.
  7. F-38 (request log).
  8. The `onSend` hook adds `X-Request-Id: <requestId>` to every response and `X-Budmon-API-Version: 1.<API_MINOR>` (F-341) to every response whose `request.routeOptions.url` starts with `/api/v1/` (A-168).

  CORS isn't registered; `OPTIONS` requests to `/api/v1/*` return `404 NOT_FOUND` (D-36).
- **Route attribute (A-176, A-186):** an oRPC interceptor sets `budmon.route` on the active span to the matched procedure's OpenAPI path template, and (from S-5, A-186) `getRPCMetadata(context.active()).route = "/api/v1" + template`, so the http SERVER span and its `http.route` use the template.
- **Errors:** a plugin registration failure rejects (the entry point exits 1).

#### F-56: client version check
- **File:** `platform/http/clientVersion.ts`
- **Signatures:** `export function parseClientHeader(value: string | undefined): { kind: ClientKind; version: number | null }`, `export function clientVersionMiddleware(versions: Config["api"]["clientVersions"]): Middleware`
- **Behaviour:**
  - `parseClientHeader`: `^(android|web)/(\d{1,10})$` → `{ kind, version }`; missing or malformed → `{ kind: "other", version: null }`.
  - The middleware runs for every procedure except `meta.clientConfig`. For `android` with `version < minAndroid`, or `web` with `version < minWeb`, it throws `ClientUpdateRequiredError(min)` and increments `client_update_required_total`. `other` is never blocked.

#### F-57: health and readiness
- **File:** `platform/http/health.ts`
- **Signatures:** `export function schemaWindow(applied: readonly { hash: string; createdAt: number }[], journal: readonly { hash: string; when: number }[]): "ok" | "behind" | "ahead"`, `export async function checkReadiness(deps: { db: Database; appEnv: AppEnv; journal: readonly { hash: string; when: number }[]; timeoutMs?: number }): Promise<{ ready: true } | { ready: false; reason: "database_unreachable" | "schema_behind" | "schema_ahead" }>`, `export function registerHealthRoutes(app: FastifyInstance, deps: { db: Database; appEnv: AppEnv; journal: readonly { hash: string; when: number }[]; timeoutMs?: number }): void` (A-125)
- **Behaviour:**
  - `schemaWindow`:
    - `"behind"` if any journal entry isn't applied;
    - `"ahead"` if more than **one** applied entry is missing from the journal;
    - otherwise `"ok"`.
  - `checkReadiness`:
    1. `SELECT 1` with a 2 s timeout; failure → `database_unreachable`.
    2. In `development`/`test`, or if `drizzle.__drizzle_migrations` doesn't exist and the journal is empty → ready; if it doesn't exist and the journal isn't empty → `schema_behind`. Migrate-mode databases always have the table (F-18, A-146), so this case arises only for push-mode databases.
    3. Otherwise reads the migrations table (`hash`, `created_at`) through the API's own `budmon_app` connection (granted by F-16 step 5, A-130) and applies `schemaWindow`.
  - Routes:
    - `GET /health/live` → `200 {"status":"ok"}`.
    - `GET /health/ready` → `200 {"status":"ready"}` or `503 {"status":"not_ready","reason":"<reason>"}`.

    Neither route is in the contract or behind auth; both send `Cache-Control: no-store`. The journal comes from F-18's `readJournal` on the image's `drizzle/` folder.

#### F-58: `meta.clientConfig` handler
- **File:** `platform/http/meta.ts` · **Layer:** router
- **Signature:** `export const metaRouter = { clientConfig: publicProcedure.meta.clientConfig.handler(({ context }) => …) }`
- **Behaviour:** returns `{ apiVersion: "1.<API_MINOR>", android: { minimumVersionCode, latestVersionCode, downloadUrl: string | null }, web: { minimumBuild } }` from configuration. Never blocked by F-56.

#### F-59: `appRouter` (A-26)
- **File:** `platform/http/appRouter.ts` · **Layer:** router (composition)
- **Signature:** `export const appRouter = base.router({ meta: metaRouter /* modules add their keys */ }); export type AppRouter = typeof appRouter;` (`base` from F-53, `metaRouter` from F-58).
- **Behaviour:** the implemented router root, mirroring F-346's `contract` key for key. Modules add their routers' keys in their own slices (identity: `auth`, `me`, `invitations`, `users`, `exports`, `deletion`). Built through `base.router`, so a contract key without an implementation fails type-checking. Files under `platform/http/**` may import modules' `*Router.js` files; F-1 bans only repositories there.
- **Errors:** none (pure).

### 4.6 Security baseline (S-5)

#### F-61: `registerSecurityHeaders`
- **File:** `platform/security/headers.ts`
- **Signature:** `export async function registerSecurityHeaders(app: FastifyInstance): Promise<void>`
- **Behaviour:** registers `@fastify/helmet` with `useDefaults: false` (A-143; it doesn't remove the headers listed last, A-151) and:
  - `contentSecurityPolicy: { directives: { "default-src": ["'none'"], "frame-ancestors": ["'none'"] } }`;
  - `strictTransportSecurity: { maxAge: 31536000, includeSubDomains: true }`;
  - `referrerPolicy: { policy: "no-referrer" }`;
  - `crossOriginResourcePolicy: { policy: "same-origin" }`;
  - `xContentTypeOptions` on.
  - **`SECURITY_HEADERS` and `applySecurityHeaders(reply)`** (same file, A-182): the fixed table of every header helmet sends on normal routes, applied where helmet's hooks don't run (`frameworkErrors`); TP-5.1 checks it equals helmet's output.
  - **Also sent (helmet's own, accepted, A-151):** `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin`, `Origin-Agent-Cluster: ?1`, `X-DNS-Prefetch-Control: off`, `X-Download-Options: noopen`, `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN`, `X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies: none`, `X-XSS-Protection: 0`.

  The SPA's own CSP is set by Caddy (§7.6).

#### F-62: `registerBodyHandling`
- **File:** `platform/security/headers.ts`
- **Signature:** `export function registerBodyHandling(app: FastifyInstance): void`
- **Behaviour:**
  - Replaces the JSON content-type parser for `application/json`, parsing with `secure-json-parse` (`protoAction: "remove"`, `constructorAction: "remove"`, A-152). Malformed JSON → `400` with the platform envelope: `VALIDATION_FAILED`, `data.issues = [{ path: [], code: "invalid_json", message: "Request body is not valid JSON." }]`. The parser's own message isn't used.
  - A body over 100 kB → `413 PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE`.
  - An unsupported content type on `POST`/`PUT`/`PATCH` → `400 VALIDATION_FAILED` with issue code `unsupported_media_type` (not 415, so clients handle one error key).

  These are written with `setErrorHandler` for Fastify-level errors only (oRPC errors never reach it). Fastify-level errors of any other kind → `500 INTERNAL` `{ outcome: "not_applied" }`, reported.

#### F-63: `createRateLimiter`
- **File:** `platform/security/rateLimiter.ts` · **Layer:** service
- **Signature:** `export interface RateLimitSpec { limiter: string; limit: number; windowSeconds: number }; export interface RateLimiter { hit(spec: RateLimitSpec, subject: string): Promise<{ allowed: boolean; retryAfterSeconds: number; hits: number }> }; export function createRateLimiter(deps: { db: Database; key: Buffer; clock: Clock }): RateLimiter`
- **Behaviour:**
  - `windowStart = floor(now / windowSeconds) × windowSeconds`.
  - `bucketKey = limiter + ":" + base64url(HMAC-SHA-256(key, subject))`.
  - Calls F-64 `incrementWindow` with `expiresAt = windowStart + 2 × windowSeconds`, in autocommit (not inside the caller's transaction, so a rolled-back request still counts).
  - `allowed = hits ≤ limit`; `retryAfterSeconds = ceil(windowStart + windowSeconds − now)` (≥ 1) when not allowed, else 0.
- **Errors:** an invalid `limiter` (not the `token` rule), `limit < 1`, or `windowSeconds` not an integer ≥ 1 (A-196) throws `RangeError`. Database errors propagate (→ 503 through F-52).

#### F-64: `rateLimitRepo`
- **File:** `platform/security/rateLimitRepo.ts` · **Layer:** repo
- **Signatures:** `export async function incrementWindow(h: DbHandle, bucketKey: string, windowStart: Date, expiresAt: Date): Promise<number>`, `export async function deleteExpired(h: DbHandle, now: Date, batchSize: number): Promise<number>`
- **Behaviour:**
  - `incrementWindow`: `INSERT … VALUES ($1,$2,1,$3) ON CONFLICT (bucket_key, window_start) DO UPDATE SET hits = rate_limit_counters.hits + 1 RETURNING hits`.
  - `deleteExpired`: deletes up to `batchSize` rows with `expires_at < now` (`ctid IN (SELECT … LIMIT n)`) and returns the count.

#### F-65: `rateLimited` middleware and the coarse limit
- **File:** `platform/security/rateLimiter.ts`
- **Signatures:** `export function rateLimited(...rules: { spec: RateLimitSpec; subject: (input: unknown, ctx: RequestContext) => string | null }[]): Middleware`, `export async function registerCoarseRateLimit(app: FastifyInstance): Promise<void>`
- **Behaviour:**
  - `rateLimited`: for each rule with a non-null subject (`ctx.ip`, or a value derived from the input such as a lower-cased email), calls `hit`. The first rule that isn't allowed throws `RateLimitedError(retryAfterSeconds)` and increments `rate_limited_total{limiter}`. Otherwise it continues.
  - No test switch (A-192): tests that need more than 300 requests from one app vary `remoteAddress`.
  - `registerCoarseRateLimit`: `@fastify/rate-limit` with `{ global: true, max: 300, timeWindow: 60000, keyGenerator: (req) => req.ip, allowList: (req) => req.url.startsWith("/health/"), errorResponseBuilder: (_, ctx) => { throw new CoarseRateLimitError(Math.ceil(ctx.ttl / 1000)) } }`, answered by F-62's error handler as the `RATE_LIMITED` 429 envelope `{ retryAfterSeconds }` with `Retry-After` (A-194); the plugin's `x-ratelimit-*` headers are off (A-195).

#### F-66: hashing utilities
- **File:** `platform/security/hashing.ts`
- **Signatures:**
  ```ts
  export async function hashSecret(plain: string): Promise<string>;              // Argon2id (the binding's default algorithm, A-197), m=19456 KiB, t=2, p=1, 16-byte salt, PHC string
  export async function verifySecret(phc: string, plain: string): Promise<boolean>;
  export function hmacSha256(key: Buffer, data: string | Buffer): Buffer;
  export function timingSafeEqualBytes(a: Uint8Array, b: Uint8Array): boolean;  // false on length mismatch, constant time otherwise
  export function randomToken(bytes?: number): string;                          // default 32, integer 16..64 else RangeError (A-200); base64url without padding
  export function sha256(data: string | Buffer): Buffer;
  ```
- **Errors:** `verifySecret` with a malformed PHC string returns `false` (it doesn't throw). `randomToken` with `bytes` outside 16..64 throws `RangeError`.

### 4.7 Jobs and workers (S-6)

#### F-70: `defineJob`
- **File:** `platform/queue/jobs.ts`
- **Signature:**
  ```ts
  export type WorkerRole = "capture" | "general";
  export interface JobDefinition<P> { readonly name: string; readonly role: WorkerRole; readonly payload: z.ZodType<P>;
    readonly retryLimit: number; readonly retryDelaySeconds: number; readonly retryBackoff: boolean;
    readonly expireInSeconds: number; readonly policy: "standard" | "stately" | "singleton" | "short"; readonly cron?: string }
  export function defineJob<P>(def: { name: string; role: WorkerRole; payload: z.ZodType<P> } & Partial<Omit<JobDefinition<P>, "name" | "role" | "payload">>): JobDefinition<P>;
  ```
- **Behaviour:** defaults `retryLimit 5`, `retryDelaySeconds 30`, `retryBackoff true`, `expireInSeconds 900`, `policy "standard"`. A `cron` makes it a scheduled job (general role only).
- **Errors:** a `name` not matching `^[a-z][a-z0-9-]*\.[a-z][a-z0-9-]*$`, `cron` on the capture role, or an invalid cron (5 fields) throws `TypeError`.

#### F-71: `createJobRegistry`
- **File:** `platform/queue/registry.ts`
- **Signature:** `export interface JobRegistry { all(): readonly JobDefinition<unknown>[]; forRole(r: WorkerRole): readonly JobDefinition<unknown>[]; get(name: string): JobDefinition<unknown> | undefined; deadLetterQueue(r: WorkerRole): string }; export function createJobRegistry(defs: readonly JobDefinition<unknown>[]): JobRegistry`
- **Behaviour:** dead-letter queues are named `dead-letter.capture` and `dead-letter.general`. They aren't definitions and have no workers.
- **Errors:** a duplicate name or a name starting with `dead-letter.` throws `TypeError`.
- **`buildJobRegistry()` (A-202):** `platform/queue/appRegistry.ts` exports `buildJobRegistry(): JobRegistry` = `createJobRegistry([...platformJobDefinitions, ...<modules' definitions>])`, used by F-92, `createApiContainer` and `createWorkerContainer`.

#### F-72: `assertPayloadSafe`
- **File:** `platform/queue/payloadSafety.ts`
- **Signature:** `export class UnsafeJobPayloadError extends Error { readonly path: string }; export function assertPayloadSafe(payload: unknown): void`
- **Behaviour:**
  - `payload` must be a plain object.
  - Each value must be: a string matching `^[A-Za-z0-9_.:+-]{1,64}$` (UUIDs, enum tokens, `YYYY-MM-DD`, RFC 3339 instants); a finite number; a boolean; `null`; an array of at most 100 such scalars; or one nested plain object of such values (depth ≤ 2).
  - `path` is the dotted path of the first offending value (e.g. `"items.3"`). The message is `"Unsafe job payload at <path>"` and never contains the value.

#### F-73: `createJobQueue`
- **File:** `platform/queue/jobQueue.ts` · **Layer:** service (injectable into every service)
- **Signature:** `export interface JobQueue { enqueue<P>(h: DbHandle, def: JobDefinition<P>, payload: P, opts?: { singletonKey?: string; startAfter?: Temporal.Instant }): Promise<string | null> }; export function createJobQueue(deps: { boss: PgBoss; registry: JobRegistry }): JobQueue`
- **Behaviour:**
  1. Checks the definition is registered.
  2. Parses `payload` with `def.payload`, then F-72.
  3. Calls `boss.send(def.name, parsed, { db: { executeSql: h.executeSql }, retryLimit, retryDelay: retryDelaySeconds, retryBackoff, expireInSeconds, singletonKey, startAfter: startAfter && new Date(startAfter.epochMilliseconds), deadLetter: registry.deadLetterQueue(def.role) })`.
  4. Returns pg-boss's id, or `null` when the queue policy or singleton key suppressed the job.

  When `h.inTransaction`, the job commits or rolls back with the caller's transaction (F-2 flow).
- **Errors:** an unregistered definition throws `Error("job not registered: <name>")`. A failed parse throws `JobPayloadInvalidError` (message lists issue paths and codes only). F-72's error propagates.

#### F-74: `installOrUpgradeQueueSchema`
- **File:** `platform/queue/queueSchema.ts` · **Layer:** infrastructure (schema step 3)
- **Signature:** `export async function installOrUpgradeQueueSchema(migrator: DbHandle): Promise<"installed" | "upgraded" | "current">`
- **Behaviour:**
  1. In one transaction: `SET LOCAL ROLE budmon_queue`. The target version is `pgboss.schema` from pg-boss's `package.json` (located with `createRequire(import.meta.url).resolve("pg-boss")` and walking up to the package root; 44 for 12.36.0).
  2. If schema `pgboss` doesn't exist, executes `getConstructionPlans("pgboss")` → `"installed"`. Else reads `SELECT version FROM pgboss.version`: below target → executes `getMigrationPlans("pgboss", current)` → `"upgraded"`; equal → `"current"`.
  3. Then, still as `budmon_queue`:
     - `GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA pgboss TO budmon_app, budmon_capture`;
     - `GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA pgboss TO budmon_app, budmon_capture`;
     - `GRANT EXECUTE ON ALL FUNCTIONS IN SCHEMA pgboss TO budmon_app, budmon_capture`;
     - `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA pgboss GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON TABLES TO budmon_app, budmon_capture`, and the same for functions (`EXECUTE`).
- **Errors:** a database version above the target throws `SchemaStepError("queue_schema_ahead")` (exit 3).

#### F-75: `syncQueues`
- **File:** `platform/queue/queueSync.ts` · **Layer:** service (schema step 6)
- **Signature:** `export async function syncQueues(boss: PgBoss, registry: JobRegistry, logger: Logger /* A-205 */): Promise<{ created: number; updated: number }>`
- **Behaviour:**
  - Uses a pg-boss instance connected as `budmon_migrator` with `SET ROLE budmon_queue` through its `db` adapter (`options: "-c role=budmon_queue"`).
  - Ensures both dead-letter queues exist (`policy "standard"`, `retentionSeconds 2592000`, `deleteAfterSeconds 2592000`).
  - For each definition: `createQueue(name, { policy, retryLimit, retryDelay, retryBackoff, expireInSeconds, deleteAfterSeconds: 604800, retentionSeconds: 1209600, deadLetter })` if missing, else `updateQueue` with the same options except `policy`.
  - Queues that exist but aren't registered are left alone and logged as `warn("queue_unregistered", { queue })`.
- **Errors:** an existing queue whose policy differs throws `SchemaStepError("queue_policy_changed", name)`: a policy change needs a queue-upgrade release (D-12).

#### F-76: `wrapHandler` and `JobFailure`
- **File:** `platform/queue/wrapper.ts`
- **Signatures:** `export class JobFailure extends Error {}; export interface JobContext { jobId: string; attempt: number; createdOn: Temporal.Instant; logger: Logger; signal: AbortSignal }; export function wrapHandler<P>(def: JobDefinition<P>, handler: (payload: P, ctx: JobContext) => Promise<unknown>, deps: { logger: Logger; metrics: PlatformMetrics; reporter: ErrorReporter; clock: Clock }): (jobs: Job<P>[]) => Promise<void>`
- **Behaviour,** for each job (batch size 1):
  1. Parses `data` with `def.payload`.
  2. Calls `handler` with a child logger (`jobId`, `jobName`, `attempt`). The return value is **discarded** (the wrapper resolves `undefined`, so completed jobs store no output).
  3. Records `job_duration_seconds` and `jobs_processed_total`.
  4. On throw (or a failed parse):
     - logs `warn("job_failed", { jobName, attempt, errorKey, errorClass })` with F-33;
     - reports to Sentry when the error isn't a `BudmonError`;
     - throws a new `JobFailure` whose `message` is `s.key ?? s.code ?? s.class` and whose `stack` is `"JobFailure: " + message + "\n    " + s.frames.join("\n    ")`. It has **no other own properties**, so pg-boss's stored `output` holds only `message` and `stack`.
  5. `attempt = job.retryCount + 1` (A-207). When `attempt > retryLimit` (the last attempt fails), increments `jobs_dead_lettered_total{queue}`.

#### F-77: `createPgBoss`
- **File:** `platform/queue/workers.ts`
- **Signature:** `export function createPgBoss(cfg: Config, mode: "send-only" | "capture" | "general"): PgBoss`
- **Behaviour:** `schema: "pgboss"`, `migrate: false`, `createSchema: false`, `useListenNotify: false`, `application_name: budmon-<mode>`, TLS settings from `cfg.db`. Per mode:

  | Mode | User | Pool `max` | `supervise` / `schedule` |
  | ---- | ---- | ---------- | ------------------------ |
  | `send-only` (api) | `budmon_app` | 2 | false / false |
  | `capture` | `budmon_capture` | 3 | false / false |
  | `general` | `budmon_queue` | `cfg.worker.queue.poolMax` | true / true |

  The `error` event is logged through F-31 with F-33.

#### F-78: `startWorkers`
- **File:** `platform/queue/workers.ts`
- **Signature:** `export async function startWorkers(c: WorkerContainer, handlers: ReadonlyMap<string, (payload: unknown, ctx: JobContext) => Promise<unknown>>): Promise<{ stop(): Promise<void> }>`
- **Behaviour:**
  1. For each role in `c.config.worker.roles`: `boss.start()`.
  2. For each definition of the role, `boss.getQueue(name)` must exist, and a handler must be in `handlers`.
  3. `boss.work(name, { batchSize: 1, pollingIntervalSeconds: 2 }, wrapHandler(...))`.
  4. General role: for each definition with `cron`, `boss.schedule(name, cron, {}, { tz: "UTC" })`. It also registers the `queue_depth` observable gauge, reading `boss.getQueues()` counts (`queuedCount`). It then enqueues `platform.fx-gap-check` once with `singletonKey "startup"` (F-139), **only if** `c.registry.get("platform.fx-gap-check")` exists (S-9 registers it, A-203).
  5. Starts F-79.
  - `stop()` calls `boss.stop({ graceful: true, timeout: 30000 })` for each instance.
- **Errors:** a missing queue throws `MissingQueueError(name)` and the process exits 1 with `error("queue_missing", { queue })`. A missing handler throws `Error("no handler for <name>")`.

#### F-78b: `runGeneralStartHooks` (A-26)
- **File:** `platform/queue/workers.ts`
- **Signature:** `export async function runGeneralStartHooks(c: Pick<WorkerContainer, "roles" | "onGeneralStarted" | "logger" | "reporter">): Promise<void>`
- **Behaviour:**
  1. `general` not in `c.roles` → returns without calling any hook.
  2. Otherwise awaits each hook of `c.onGeneralStarted` in array order, each exactly once.
  3. A hook that rejects: `c.reporter.report(err, { route: "worker:onGeneralStarted" })`, then `c.logger.error("worker_start_hook_failed", { step: "onGeneralStarted:<index>" })` with F-33's sanitised error, then the next hook runs. Hooks are catch-up work (identity's start-up erasure sweep) whose cron runs later anyway, so a failure doesn't stop the worker.
- **Errors:** never rejects.
- **Calls:** F-34 (`reporter`), F-31, F-33.

#### F-79: `startHeartbeat`
- **File:** `platform/queue/heartbeat.ts`
- **Signature:** `export function startHeartbeat(deps: { metrics: PlatformMetrics /* A-206 */; logger: Logger /* A-206 */; clock: Clock; service: string; intervalMs?: number; setInterval?: typeof setInterval /* [inj] */; writeFile?: (path: string, data: string) => void /* [inj], default fs.writeFileSync */; path?: string /* default "/tmp/heartbeat" */ }): { stop(): void; last(): number }`
- **Behaviour:** immediately and then every `intervalMs` (default 15000), stores `t = clock.now().epochMilliseconds / 1000` and writes `String(Math.floor(t))` to `path` (`/tmp` is the container's tmpfs). `worker_heartbeat_timestamp_seconds{service}` observes `last()`. A write failure is logged once as `warn("heartbeat_write_failed")` and doesn't stop the timer.

#### F-80: platform maintenance jobs
- **File:** `platform/maintenance/maintenanceJobs.ts`
- **Exports (A-210):** `platformMaintenanceJobs` (the definitions below), `purgeIdempotencyRecords(deps: { database: Database; clock: Clock; logger: Logger }): Promise<number>`, `purgeRateLimitCounters(deps): Promise<number>`, `maintenanceHandlers(c: WorkerContainer)` (merged by `buildHandlerMap`).
- **Definitions:** `platform.idempotency-purge` (general, cron `0 3 * * *`), `platform.rate-limit-purge` (general, cron `*/10 * * * *`), `platform.exports-purge` (general, cron `15 * * * *`, handler F-144). Each has an empty payload `z.object({})`.
- **Behaviour:**
  - The idempotency purge repeats `DELETE FROM idempotency_records WHERE ctid IN (SELECT ctid FROM idempotency_records WHERE expires_at < $now LIMIT 5000)` until fewer than 5000 rows are affected, and logs `info("idempotency_purged", { count })` **once per run** with the total (A-210).
  - The rate-limit purge is F-64 `deleteExpired` in batches of 10000 until fewer are deleted; one `info("rate_limits_purged", { count })` per run (A-210).

#### F-81: dead-letter commands
- **File:** `platform/queue/deadLetter.ts`; CLI in F-93
- **Signatures:** `export async function listDeadLetters(boss: PgBoss, role?: WorkerRole, limit?: number): Promise<{ id: string; sourceName: string | null; sourceId: string | null; createdOn: string; sourceRetryCount: number | null; failure: string | null }[]>`, `export async function redriveDeadLetter(boss: PgBoss, role: WorkerRole, id: string): Promise<number>`
- **Behaviour:**
  - `listDeadLetters` uses `boss.findJobs("dead-letter.<role>", …)` with metadata (both roles when `role` is absent), newest first, up to `limit` (default 100). `failure` is `sourceOutput.message`, the sanitised key or class from F-76.
  - `redriveDeadLetter` calls `boss.redrive("dead-letter.<role>", { ids: [id] })` and returns the count moved (0 if the id doesn't exist).

### 4.8 Process entry points and composition root (S-2 to S-6)

#### F-89: `main/instrument.ts` (telemetry preload, A-147)
- **File:** `apps/server/src/main/instrument.ts`, bundled as `dist/main/instrument.js`; run with `node --import ./dist/main/instrument.js dist/main/<api|worker>.js` (development: `tsx --import ./apps/server/src/main/instrument.ts`).
- **Exports** (defined in `platform/observability/telemetryHandle.ts`, which has no side effects, and re-exported here; entries import the handle module, A-155): `export interface TelemetryHandle { metrics: Metrics; shutdown(): Promise<void> }`; `export function getTelemetry(): TelemetryHandle` (the stored handle, or a no-op handle whose metrics are no-ops).
- **Behaviour,** at module evaluation (top-level `await`):
  1. `module.register("@opentelemetry/instrumentation/hook.mjs", import.meta.url)`.
  2. `kind` = the base name of `process.argv[1]` with a `.js`, `.mjs` or `.ts` suffix removed (A-201); not `api` or `worker` → return.
  3. `loadConfig(kind, process.env, readFileSync)` in `try`; any error → return (the entry reports it).
  4. Dynamically imports F-36 and calls `startTelemetry({ endpoint, headers, service, release, environment }, { onDrop })`.
  5. Stores the handle at `globalThis[Symbol.for("budmon.telemetry")]` and creates F-42's `telemetry_attributes_dropped_total` on the global meter, through which `onDrop` counts (A-156). The worker's service name is `worker-<role>` for one role, else `worker` (A-157). `module.register` carries a described lint suppression (A-159).
- **Errors:** none escape; a failure to start telemetry logs nothing here (no logger yet) and leaves `getTelemetry()` a no-op.

#### F-90: `main/api.ts`
- **Behaviour:**
  1. `installProxySupport(process.env)` (F-122).
  2. `loadConfig("api", process.env, fs.readFileSync)`.
  3. `getTelemetry()` (F-89; telemetry was started by the `--import` preload, A-147).
  4. `createApiContainer` (F-96), then `await container.boss.start()` (the send-only pg-boss, A-209).
  5. `createApiServer` (F-55), then `listen({ port, host })`.
  - Started as `node --import ./dist/main/instrument.js dist/main/api.js` (A-147).
  - On `SIGTERM`/`SIGINT`, within one **8 s** budget (A-180): `app.close()` (up to 5 s), then `container.close()` and `getTelemetry().shutdown()` (each at most 2 s, within what remains); when the budget runs out, exit 0 anyway (unflushed telemetry is dropped). Compose gives `api` `stop_grace_period: 15s`.
  - Logs `info("api_started")` with no fields; `service` and `release` are the logger's fixed keys (A-161).
  - **Process handlers and start-up logger (A-118, A-120):** first `const state = startupState("api", process.env)` and `installFatalHandlers(state)` (F-39), before anything else; after `loadConfig` succeeds, `state.logger` and `state.reporter` are replaced by the configured logger and `initSentry`'s reporter. Start-up failures before that log through `state.logger`. F-91 the same with `"worker"`.
- **Errors:** `ConfigError` → exit 78 (F-11). Any start-up error → `error("startup_failed", describeFailure(err))` (F-26, A-81; F-33 for the error report from S-3), then exit 1.

#### F-91: `main/worker.ts`
- **Testable entry (A-201):** `export async function runWorker(env, overrides?: { registry?: JobRegistry; handlers?: ReadonlyMap<string, Handler> }): Promise<{ stop(): Promise<void> }>`; the entry guard calls `runWorker(process.env)`; `overrides.registry` replaces `buildJobRegistry()`, `overrides.handlers` merge over `buildHandlerMap(c)`.
- **Shutdown budget (A-180):** 35 s overall: `stop()` (pg-boss graceful, up to 30 s), then container and telemetry within the remaining 5 s; Compose gives the workers `stop_grace_period: 45s`.
- **Interim (A-158):** until S-6 the worker validates configuration, calls `getTelemetry().shutdown()` and exits 0; from S-6 shutdown follows `stop()` on `SIGTERM`.
- **Behaviour:** like F-90 for kind `worker` (started as `node --import ./dist/main/instrument.js dist/main/worker.js`, telemetry from F-89, A-147): `createWorkerContainer`, then `startWorkers` with the handler map built from the platform's and every module's job handlers (`platform/queue/handlers.ts` exports `buildHandlerMap(c)`, which merges each module's handler map, for example identity's `identityHandlers(…)`; the factory's argument is the module's choice), then F-78b `runGeneralStartHooks(c)` once `startWorkers` has resolved (A-26). Service name: `worker-capture`, `worker-general` or `worker` (several roles, development only). `SIGTERM` → `stop()`.

#### F-92: `main/migrate.ts` (`pnpm db:migrate`, image entry `node dist/main/migrate.js`)
- **Behaviour:**
  1. `loadConfig("migrate")`.
  1b. Validates the journal (`readJournal(join(serverRoot(), "drizzle"))`, F-18) before connecting; `JournalInvalidError` → exit 5, nothing touched (A-162).
  2. Connects as `DB_USER` (must be `budmon_migrator`) with `DB_PASSWORD`. If that fails with SQLSTATE `28P01` (invalid password) and `DB_PASSWORD_PREVIOUS_FILE` is configured, it retries once with the previous password and logs `warn("migrator_previous_password_used")`. This is how a rotated migrator password takes effect: the schema step then applies the new verifier from `ROLE_SECRETS`, and the next deploy logs in with the new password.
  3. F-19 with `mode: "migrate"` and `migrationsFolder: join(serverRoot(), "drizzle")` (F-25, A-43).
  4. Prints the `SchemaStepReport` as one JSON line to stdout and exits 0. Its logger writes to stderr (A-109), so stdout holds exactly that line.
- **Testable entry (A-83):** `export async function runMigrate(env: Readonly<Record<string, string | undefined>>): Promise<number>`, returning the exit code; the entry guard passes `process.env`. It never reads `.env`.
- **Failure log (A-81):** every failure other than `ConfigError` logs `error("startup_failed", describeFailure(err))` (F-26), so a bad password logs `errorClass` and `errorCode "28P01"`, an unreachable database a system code such as `ECONNREFUSED`, and a schema-step failure its code and subject.
- **Exit codes:** 78 config; 3 `SchemaStepError`; 4 `UnknownMigrationError`; 5 migration SQL failure or `JournalInvalidError` (A-150); 1 other.

#### F-93: `main/cli.ts` (`node dist/main/cli.js <command>`)
- **Commands:**

  | Command | Calls | Output | Exit |
  | ------- | ----- | ------ | ---- |
  | `jobs:dead list [--role capture\|general] [--limit n]` | F-81 | one JSON line per entry | 0 |
  | `jobs:dead redrive --role r --id <uuid>` | F-81 | `{"moved":n}` | 0 if moved = 1, else 2 |
  | `secrets:rewrap-api` | F-117's `rewrapApiSecretsCommand(createApiContainer(config))`, then `close()` (A-26: the columns come from `container.sealedColumns.all()`) | `{"rewrapped":n,"skipped":m}` | 0 |
  | `restore:verify` | F-150 | report JSON | 0 if ok, else 6. Always run as the `migrate` service (role `budmon_migrator`, which holds `pg_read_all_data` and `EXECUTE` on `bt_index_check`) with that service's secrets; `budmon-local restore` adds `DB_NAME=budmon_restore` (F-178). |
  | `erasure:replay --since <RFC 3339>` | F-151 | `{"replayed":n}` | 0, 2 if no handler is registered and records exist |
  | `jobs:capture-rewrap` | enqueues `platform.capture-rewrap` (F-118) | `{"enqueued":true}` | 0 |
  | `diagnostics:sentry-test --yes` | `errorReporter.report(new Error("budmon sentry test"), { route: "cli:diagnostics:sentry-test" })` (F-34; the event carries only the sanitised class, `Error`, and the tag), then `flush(5000)` | `{"sent":true}`, or `{"sent":false}` when `SENTRY_DSN` is empty | 0; 2 without `--yes` |

  | `identity:bootstrap-owner --email <address> [--replace]` (A-6) | the `identity` module's handler, registered in F-93's command table by identity's build | the bootstrap link on **stdout only** (never through the logger, `ErrorReporter` or telemetry) | 0 on success; 1 on refusal (an owner exists, or a pending bootstrap invitation without `--replace`); 64 on usage errors |

  Unknown command → `Unknown command: <name>` and the usage text, exit 64. Config kind: `worker` with `WORKER_ROLES=general` for every command except `secrets:rewrap-api` and `identity:bootstrap-owner` (kind `api`; the latter connects as `budmon_app` and uses the API's `PUBLIC_ORIGIN` for the link). In stage 0 it's run only inside the running `api` container through `budmon-local bootstrap-owner` (F-178), because `docker compose exec` output isn't captured by the logging driver; a one-off `compose run` container would put the token into the json-file logs.

#### F-94: `main/dbReset.ts` (`pnpm db:reset`)
- **Testable entry (A-58):** `export async function runDbResetCli(argv: readonly string[], deps: { env: Readonly<Record<string, string | undefined>>; readFile: (path: string) => string; resetDevelopmentDatabase: typeof resetDevelopmentDatabase; seedDevelopmentDatabase: typeof seedDevelopmentDatabase; seedAll: () => Promise<void>; stderr: (line: string) => void }): Promise<number>`; the module's entry guard (as in F-6) first runs `process.chdir(join(serverRoot(), "../.."))` (A-73), then calls it with `process.env` merged **over** the parsed `<repo>/.env` when that file exists (`node:util` `parseEnv`; the shell wins; `.env` is never created here) (A-64). Order: (1) argv, before any read: every argument that is exactly `--` is ignored (A-95); only `--seed-only` and `--no-seed` are known (`Unknown argument: <arg>`, exit 64); (2) `DEV_SUPERUSER_URL` from `env` (missing → `DEV_SUPERUSER_URL is not set`, exit 64); `appEnv = env.APP_ENV ?? "development"`; (3) `--seed-only` reads no file; (4) a reset reads `env.ROLE_SECRETS_FILE ?? ".data/dev-secrets/roles.json"` (relative paths against the repository root, `join(serverRoot(), "../..")`), takes `budmon_migrator`'s password from it, and uses `databaseName = env.DB_NAME ?? "budmon"`. `seedAll` returns at once while `seeders` is empty (until S-9, A-72); otherwise it builds a worker container from the development configuration, runs F-23 `runSeeders` and closes it.
- **Behaviour:** reads `DEV_SUPERUSER_URL` and the dev role secrets. With `--seed-only` (root `pnpm db:seed`, §2.2.2, A-14) it calls F-20's `seedDevelopmentDatabase` and nothing else; otherwise it calls F-20 `resetDevelopmentDatabase` with `seed: !argv.includes("--no-seed")`. `--seed-only` together with `--no-seed` prints "--seed-only and --no-seed can't be combined" and exits 64. Exit codes: 0 success; 2 `ResetRefusedError`; 1 any other error.

#### F-95: `main/dev.ts`: see F-22.

#### F-96: composition root
- **File:** `platform/container.ts`
- **Signatures:**
  ```ts
  export interface BaseContainer { config: Config; logger: Logger; clock: Clock; ids: IdGenerator; database: Database; metrics: PlatformMetrics;
    reporter: ErrorReporter; registry: JobRegistry; queue: JobQueue; boss: PgBoss;
    sealedColumns: SealedColumnRegistry;                    // A-26 (F-115)
    close(): Promise<void> }
  export interface ApiContainer extends BaseContainer { authHook: AuthHook; rateLimiter: RateLimiter; idempotency: Idempotency; cursors: CursorCodec;
    captureSealer: CaptureSealer; apiSecrets: ApiSecretsCipher; objectStore: ObjectStore; fx: FxService;
    moduleRoutes: ((app: import("fastify").FastifyInstance) => void)[] }   // A-26
  export interface WorkerContainer extends BaseContainer { roles: ReadonlySet<WorkerRole>; captureSealer: CaptureSealer | null; captureUnsealer: CaptureUnsealer | null;
    fx: FxService; objectStore: ObjectStore | null; erasureLog: ErasureLog | null; fxProviders: FxProviders | null; queueBoss: PgBoss | null; captureBoss: PgBoss | null;
    erasureHandler: ErasureHandler | null;                  // A-26 (F-146)
    onGeneralStarted: (() => Promise<void>)[] }             // A-26 (F-78b)
  export function createApiContainer(config: Config, overrides?: Partial<ApiContainer>): ApiContainer;
  export function createWorkerContainer(config: Config, overrides?: Partial<WorkerContainer>): WorkerContainer;
  ```
- **Behaviour:** builds every dependency from config in dependency order, letting `overrides` replace any entry (tests).
  - **Module wiring (A-26),** in this order: (1) the platform members; (2) `sealedColumns` (`overrides.sealedColumns` or `createSealedColumnRegistry()`), `moduleRoutes` and `onGeneralStarted` (the override's array or `[]`); (3) module members: identity's S-0 adds `identity: IdentityModule` to both interfaces (the platform doesn't declare it, because the type is identity's) and builds it here, so it registers into step 2's registry and appends to step 2's arrays; (4) `authHook` = `overrides.authHook`, else the module's (`identity.authHook`), else `noAuthHook` (F-54); `erasureHandler` = `overrides.erasureHandler`, else the module's, else `null`. Before any module exists, the defaults are `noAuthHook`, `null`, `[]` and an empty registry. Other modules register ports and subscriptions on `container.identity` here too, before the server or workers start. Capture-only members (`captureUnsealer`, `captureBoss`) are `null` unless the `capture` role is present. General-only members (`objectStore`, `erasureLog`, `fxProviders`, `queueBoss`) are `null` unless `general` is present. **`fx` (F-132) is built for every worker role** (and the API): worker-capture runs `transactions`' service when capturing, and budget progress needs conversion. It only reads `currencies`/`exchange_rates` (granted to both roles) and enqueues backfills, which `budmon_capture` may send. `close()` stops pg-boss instances and closes the database pool.

### 4.9 Idempotency and cursors (S-7)

#### F-100: `createIdempotency`
- **File:** `platform/idempotency/idempotency.ts` · **Layer:** service
- **Signature:**
  ```ts
  export interface CreatedResult { id: string; createdAt: Temporal.Instant }
  export interface Idempotency {
    run(h: DbHandle, req: { userId: string; key: string; procedure: string; input: unknown },
        work: () => Promise<CreatedResult>): Promise<{ result: CreatedResult; replayed: boolean; status: 201 }>;
  }
  export function createIdempotency(deps: { clock: Clock; metrics: PlatformMetrics }): Idempotency;
  ```
- **Behaviour:**
  - Precondition: `h.inTransaction` is true.
  - `requestHash = sha256(canonicalJson(input))`, where `input` is the procedure's **validated** input (wire values, after zod defaults).
  1. F-101 `insertIfAbsent(h, { userId, key, procedure, requestHash, expiresAt: now + 90 days })`.
     - **Inserted:** `result = await work()`, then F-101 `complete(h, userId, key, 201, { id, createdAt: createdAt.toString() })`. Returns `{ result, replayed: false, status: 201 }`.
     - **Not inserted** (an existing row; a concurrent duplicate waits on the primary key until the first transaction ends): F-101 `find(h, userId, key)`.
       - Different `procedure` or `requestHash` → throws `IdempotencyKeyReusedError`.
       - `responseStatus` null → throws `Error("idempotency record incomplete")` (→ `INTERNAL`; unreachable when callers use one transaction).
       - Otherwise returns the stored result with `replayed: true` and increments `idempotent_replays_total`.
  - A `work()` failure rolls back the caller's transaction, insert included, so no record remains.
- **Errors:** as above. `h.inTransaction === false` throws `Error("idempotency requires a transaction")`.

#### F-101: `idempotencyRepo`
- **File:** `platform/idempotency/idempotencyRepo.ts` · **Layer:** repo
- **Signatures:** `insertIfAbsent(h: DbHandle, r: { userId: string; key: string; procedure: string; requestHash: Buffer; expiresAt: Date }): Promise<boolean>`, `find(h: DbHandle, userId: string, key: string): Promise<{ procedure: string; requestHash: Buffer; responseStatus: number | null; result: { id: string; createdAt: string } | null } | null>`, `complete(h: DbHandle, userId: string, key: string, status: number, result: { id: string; createdAt: string }): Promise<void>`
- **Behaviour:** `insertIfAbsent` uses `INSERT … ON CONFLICT (user_id, idempotency_key) DO NOTHING RETURNING 1`. `complete` also sets `updated_at = now()`.

#### F-102: `runIdempotentCreate`
- **File:** `platform/idempotency/idempotency.ts` · **Layer:** router helper
- **Signature:** `export async function runIdempotentCreate<I>(ctx: RequestContext & { principal: Principal }, procedure: string, input: I, work: (tx: DbHandle) => Promise<CreatedResult>): Promise<{ id: string; createdAt: string }>`
- **Behaviour:**
  1. Reads `ctx.headers["idempotency-key"]`, which must be a lower-case RFC 9562 UUID.
  2. `withTransaction(db, (tx) => idempotency.run(tx, { userId: ctx.principal.userId, key, procedure, input }, () => work(tx)), { tracker: ctx.commitTracker })`.
  3. On a replay, sets the response header `Idempotent-Replayed: true`.
  4. Returns the wire shape `{ id, createdAt: createdAt.toString() }` (RFC 3339 with `Z`).
- **Errors:** a missing or invalid header throws `ValidationFailedError([{ path: ["headers", "idempotency-key"], code: "invalid_idempotency_key", message: "Idempotency-Key must be a UUID" }])`. F-100's errors propagate.

#### F-103: `createCursorCodec`
- **File:** `platform/pagination/cursor.ts` · **Layer:** service
- **Signature:**
  ```ts
  export type SortKey = readonly (string | number | boolean | null)[];
  export interface CursorCodec { encode(p: { sortKey: SortKey; id: string; filterHash: string }): string;
    decode(token: string, expectedFilterHash: string): { sortKey: SortKey; id: string } }
  export function createCursorCodec(deps: { key: Buffer; clock: Clock; randomBytes?: (n: number) => Buffer /* [inj] */ }): CursorCodec;
  ```
- **Behaviour:**
  - Plaintext `canonicalJson({ v: 1, s: sortKey, id, f: filterHash, exp: nowEpochSeconds + 86400 })`.
  - AES-256-GCM with a 12-byte random nonce and no AAD.
  - Token `base64url(0x01 ‖ nonce ‖ ciphertext ‖ tag)`, no padding.
  - `decode` reverses this and checks `exp ≥ now` and `f === expectedFilterHash`.
- **Errors:** `decode` throws `ValidationFailedError([{ path: ["cursor"], code: "invalid_cursor", message: "Invalid cursor" }])` for any of: length > 512, a base64 failure, a wrong version byte, an authentication failure, malformed JSON, an expired cursor, or a filter mismatch. All are indistinguishable.

#### F-104: `filterHash`
- **File:** `platform/pagination/cursor.ts`
- **Signature:** `export function filterHash(filters: unknown): string`
- **Behaviour:** the first 22 characters of `base64url(sha256(canonicalJson(filters)))`.

#### F-105: `paginate`
- **File:** `platform/pagination/cursor.ts`
- **Signature:** `export function paginate<T>(rows: readonly T[], limit: number, keyOf: (row: T) => { sortKey: SortKey; id: string }, filterHashValue: string, codec: CursorCodec): { items: T[]; nextCursor: string | null }`
- **Behaviour:** callers fetch `limit + 1` rows. If `rows.length > limit`, returns the first `limit` rows and a cursor built from the last returned row; otherwise all rows and `nextCursor: null`.

### 4.10 Credential encryption and capture plumbing (S-8)

#### F-110: envelope format
- **File:** `platform/crypto/envelope.ts`
- **Signatures:**
  ```ts
  export type EnvelopeProvider = "kms-capture" | "local-capture" | "api-local";
  export interface SealContext { table: string; rowId: string; purpose: string }
  export interface EnvelopeParts { provider: EnvelopeProvider; keyVersion: string; wrappedDek: Buffer; nonce: Buffer; ciphertext: Buffer; tag: Buffer }
  export class EnvelopeFormatError extends Error {}
  export function encodeEnvelope(p: EnvelopeParts): Buffer;
  export function decodeEnvelope(b: Buffer): EnvelopeParts;
  export function aadFor(ctx: SealContext): Buffer; // utf8 "budmon/v1|<table>|<rowId>|<purpose>"
  export function keyVersionOf(b: Buffer): string;
  ```
- **Byte layout (v1):**

  | Offset | Size | Field |
  | ------ | ---- | ----- |
  | 0 | 1 | `0x01` (format version) |
  | 1 | 1 | provider (`0x01` kms-capture, `0x02` local-capture, `0x03` api-local) |
  | 2 | 1 | `L`, the key-version length (1..255) |
  | 3 | L | key version, UTF-8 |
  | 3+L | 2 | `W`, the wrapped-DEK length (big-endian, 1..1024) |
  | 5+L | W | wrapped DEK |
  | 5+L+W | 12 | nonce |
  | 17+L+W | n | ciphertext (n ≥ 0) |
  | end−16 | 16 | GCM tag |
- **Errors:** a short buffer, unknown version or provider, or out-of-range lengths throw `EnvelopeFormatError` (no content in the message). `aadFor` with a field not matching `^[A-Za-z0-9_.:-]{1,64}$` throws `RangeError`.

#### F-111: `createCaptureSealer`
- **File:** `platform/crypto/captureSealer.ts` · **Layer:** service (api, worker-general, worker-capture)
- **Signature:** `export interface CaptureSealer { seal(plaintext: Buffer, ctx: SealContext): Buffer }; export function createCaptureSealer(cfg: { publicKeyPem: string; keyVersion: string }, deps?: { randomBytes?: (n: number) => Buffer /* [inj] */ }): CaptureSealer`
- **Behaviour:**
  1. Generates a 32-byte DEK and a 12-byte nonce.
  2. AES-256-GCM over `plaintext` with `aadFor(ctx)`.
  3. Wraps the DEK with `crypto.publicEncrypt({ key: publicKeyPem, padding: RSA_PKCS1_OAEP_PADDING, oaepHash: "sha256" }, dek)`.
  4. The provider is `local-capture` if `keyVersion` starts with `local:`, otherwise `kms-capture`.
  5. Zero-fills the DEK (`dek.fill(0)`) and returns F-110's encoding.
- **Errors:** a public key under 3072 bits or not RSA throws `TypeError` at construction.

#### F-112: `createKmsCaptureUnsealer`
- **File:** `platform/crypto/captureUnsealer.ts` · **Layer:** service (worker-capture only)
- **Signature:** `export interface CaptureUnsealer { unseal(envelope: Buffer, ctx: SealContext): Promise<Buffer> }; export function createKmsCaptureUnsealer(deps: { client: Pick<KeyManagementServiceClient, "asymmetricDecrypt"> /* [inj] */; timeoutMs?: number; metrics: PlatformMetrics }): CaptureUnsealer`
- **Behaviour:**
  1. Decodes the envelope; the provider must be `kms-capture`.
  2. `client.asymmetricDecrypt({ name: keyVersion, ciphertext: wrappedDek }, { timeout: timeoutMs ?? 5000 })`.
  3. AES-256-GCM decrypt with `aadFor(ctx)`.
  4. Zero-fills the DEK and returns the plaintext.
- **Errors:**
  - Provider mismatch → `EnvelopeFormatError`.
  - Any KMS error or timeout → `KmsUnavailableError` (retryable), and increments `kms_errors_total`.
  - GCM authentication failure → `EnvelopeAuthError` (not retryable; the job fails and reaches the dead-letter queue).

#### F-113: `createLocalCaptureUnsealer`
- **File:** `platform/crypto/captureUnsealer.ts`
- **Signature:** `export function createLocalCaptureUnsealer(cfg: { privateKeyPem: string }): CaptureUnsealer`
- **Behaviour:** as F-112, with `crypto.privateDecrypt` (OAEP SHA-256) and provider `local-capture` only. F-96 picks it when `KMS_PROVIDER=local`, which F-10 refuses in `production`.

#### F-114: `createApiSecretsCipher`
- **File:** `platform/crypto/apiSecrets.ts`
- **Signature:** `export interface ApiSecretsCipher { seal(plaintext: Buffer, ctx: SealContext): Buffer; unseal(envelope: Buffer, ctx: SealContext): Buffer; currentKeyId(): string }; export function createApiSecretsCipher(keys: { current: string; keys: ReadonlyMap<string, Buffer> }, deps?: { randomBytes?: (n: number) => Buffer }): ApiSecretsCipher`
- **Behaviour:** the provider is `api-local` and `keyVersion` is the key id. The DEK is wrapped with AES-256-GCM under the key-encryption key (`wrappedDek = nonce(12) ‖ ct(32) ‖ tag(16)`, no AAD). The payload is encrypted as in F-111.
- **Errors:** `unseal` with a key id not in `keys` → `UnknownKeyVersionError`; authentication failure → `EnvelopeAuthError`; a wrong provider → `EnvelopeFormatError`.

#### F-115: sealed-column registry
- **File:** `platform/crypto/sealedColumns.ts`
- **Signature:** `export interface SealedColumn { table: string; idColumn: string; column: string; purpose: string; provider: "capture" | "api" }; export interface SealedColumnRegistry { register(c: SealedColumn): void; all(): readonly SealedColumn[] }; export function createSealedColumnRegistry(): SealedColumnRegistry` (the interface name: A-26)
- **Behaviour:** modules register their sealed columns at container build, into `container.sealedColumns` (F-96, A-26), which exists in the API and every worker container. The platform registers none. `all()` returns them in registration order.
- **Errors:** identifiers not matching `^[a-z_][a-z0-9_]{0,62}$`, a purpose failing the `token` rule, or a duplicate `(table, column)` throw `TypeError`.

#### F-117: `rewrapApiSecrets`
- **File:** `platform/crypto/rewrap.ts`
- **Signatures:** `export async function rewrapApiSecrets(deps: { database: Database; cipher: ApiSecretsCipher; columns: readonly SealedColumn[]; batchSize?: number; logger: Logger }): Promise<{ rewrapped: number; skipped: number }>`; `export async function rewrapApiSecretsCommand(c: Pick<ApiContainer, "database" | "apiSecrets" | "sealedColumns" | "logger">): Promise<{ rewrapped: number; skipped: number }>` (A-26), which calls `rewrapApiSecrets({ database: c.database, cipher: c.apiSecrets, columns: c.sealedColumns.all(), logger: c.logger })`. F-93's `secrets:rewrap-api` calls the command form.
- **Behaviour:** for each column with `provider: "api"`, repeatedly:
  1. Selects up to `batchSize` (default 500) rows: `SELECT <id>, <col> FROM <table> WHERE <col> IS NOT NULL AND substring(<col> from 4 for get_byte(<col>, 2)) <> convert_to($current, 'UTF8') LIMIT $n`.
  2. In one transaction per batch, for each row: `unseal` with `{ table, rowId: id, purpose }`, then `seal` with the current key, then `UPDATE … SET <col> = $new WHERE <id> = $id AND <col> = $old`.
  3. A row updated 0 times (changed concurrently) counts as `skipped`.

  The loop stops when a batch returns no rows. Identifiers are quoted with `pg`'s `escapeIdentifier`.
- **Errors:** `UnknownKeyVersionError` and `EnvelopeAuthError` abort that batch's transaction and propagate (CLI exit 1), naming table and column only.

#### F-118: `platform.capture-rewrap` job
- **File:** `platform/crypto/rewrap.ts`
- **Definition:** `defineJob({ name: "platform.capture-rewrap", role: "capture", payload: z.object({}), retryLimit: 3, expireInSeconds: 3600, policy: "singleton" })`
- **Behaviour:** like F-117 for the worker container's `c.sealedColumns.all()` columns with `provider: "capture"` (A-26). Rows qualify when their key version ≠ `config.capture.keyVersion`. Each row is unsealed through F-112/F-113 and sealed with F-111. Batches of 100. Logs `info("capture_rewrap", { count })`.

#### F-119: PKCE, state and the authorisation URL
- **File:** `platform/crypto/oauth.ts`
- **Signatures:**
  ```ts
  export function createPkcePair(randomBytes?: (n: number) => Buffer): { verifier: Secret<string>; challenge: string; method: "S256" };
  export function createOAuthState(): string; // randomToken(32)
  export function buildGoogleAuthorizationUrl(p: { clientId: string; redirectUri: string; scopes: readonly string[]; state: string; challenge: string; loginHint?: never }): URL;
  ```
- **Behaviour:**
  - The verifier is the base64url of 32 random bytes (43 characters). The challenge is `base64url(sha256(verifier))`.
  - The URL is `https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth` with `response_type=code`, `client_id`, `redirect_uri`, `scope` (space-joined), `state`, `code_challenge`, `code_challenge_method=S256`, `access_type=offline`, `prompt=consent` and `include_granted_scopes=true`.
  - The API reads `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` (kind `api`, optional; added to F-10 for both `api` and capture workers).

#### F-120: `exchangeAuthorizationCode`
- **File:** `platform/crypto/oauth.ts` · **Layer:** integration (worker-capture only)
- **Signature:**
  ```ts
  export interface OAuthTokens { refreshToken: Secret<string>; accessToken: Secret<string>; expiresAt: Temporal.Instant; scopes: readonly string[] }
  export class OAuthExchangeError extends Error { readonly reason: "invalid_grant" | "rejected" | "no_refresh_token" | "server" | "network"; readonly retryable: boolean }
  export async function exchangeAuthorizationCode(deps: { fetch: typeof fetch /* [inj], guarded by F-121 */; clientId: string; clientSecret: Secret<string>; clock: Clock },
    input: { code: Secret<string>; verifier: Secret<string>; redirectUri: string }): Promise<OAuthTokens>;
  ```
- **Behaviour:** `POST https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token`, `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, body `grant_type=authorization_code&code&code_verifier&client_id&client_secret&redirect_uri`, `AbortSignal.timeout(10000)`, `redirect: "manual"`. On 200 it parses `{ access_token, expires_in, refresh_token, scope }`; `expiresAt = now + expires_in` seconds.
- **Errors** (`OAuthExchangeError`, whose message is only the reason):

  | Condition | `reason` | `retryable` |
  | --------- | -------- | ----------- |
  | 200 without `refresh_token` | `no_refresh_token` | false |
  | 400 with `error: "invalid_grant"` | `invalid_grant` | false |
  | Other 4xx | `rejected` | false |
  | 5xx or 429 | `server` | true |
  | Network error or timeout | `network` | true |

  Response bodies are never kept on the error.

#### F-121: egress guard
- **File:** `platform/crypto/egress.ts`
- **Signatures:** `export const CAPTURE_EGRESS_HOSTS: ReadonlySet<string>; export class EgressDeniedError extends Error { readonly host: string }; export function createGuardedFetch(allowed: ReadonlySet<string>, inner: typeof fetch): typeof fetch`
- **Behaviour:**
  - `CAPTURE_EGRESS_HOSTS = { "oauth2.googleapis.com", "gmail.googleapis.com", "cloudkms.googleapis.com", "pubsub.googleapis.com" }`, plus the Sentry DSN host, added at container build from config.
  - The guarded fetch rejects a URL unless: the protocol is `https:`, there's no user info, the port is empty or `443`, and the hostname is exactly in `allowed`. It forces `redirect: "manual"`.
  - worker-capture passes this fetch to F-120 and to every capture integration. Google client libraries (KMS, Pub/Sub over gRPC) are constructed with `apiEndpoint` set to the allowlisted host explicitly.
- **Errors:** `EgressDeniedError(host)` (the host isn't sensitive).

#### F-122: `installProxySupport`
- **File:** `platform/crypto/proxy.ts`
- **Signature:** `export function installProxySupport(env: Readonly<Record<string, string | undefined>>): { httpsProxy?: string }`
- **Behaviour:** always calls `setGlobalDispatcher(new EnvHttpProxyAgent())` (undici), which honours `HTTPS_PROXY`, `HTTP_PROXY` and `NO_PROXY`; with none set, it connects directly. Returns `HTTPS_PROXY ?? https_proxy` for Sentry's transport (F-34). gRPC (`@grpc/grpc-js`) and gaxios read the standard variables themselves (`grpc_proxy`/`https_proxy`, `no_grpc_proxy`/`no_proxy`). Called first in every entry point (F-90, F-91, F-92, F-93). **No code path checks whether a proxy is set** (D-29 rule 3 (b)).

### 4.11 FX (S-9)

#### F-130: provider decimal parsing
- **File:** `platform/fx/decimal.ts`
- **Signatures:** `export function parseJsonKeepingNumberText(text: string): unknown`, `export function normaliseRate(raw: string): string | null`
- **Behaviour:**
  - `parseJsonKeepingNumberText` uses `JSON.parse(text, (key, value, context) => typeof value === "number" ? context.source : value)`, so numbers become their exact source text.
  - `normaliseRate` parses with F-300 `parseDecimal` and returns `toFixedDecimalString(r, 12)`. It returns `null` for unparseable input, `r ≤ 0`, or `r ≥ 10^12`.

#### F-131: `fxRepo`
- **File:** `platform/fx/fxRepo.ts` · **Layer:** repo
- **Signatures:**
  ```ts
  latestDayOnOrBefore(h: DbHandle, date: string): Promise<string | null>;
  ratesOn(h: DbHandle, date: string, codes: readonly string[]): Promise<Map<string, string>>;
  dayExists(h: DbHandle, date: string): Promise<boolean>;
  nextStoredDayAfter(h: DbHandle, date: string): Promise<string | null>;
  insertDay(h: DbHandle, rows: readonly { code: string; unitsPerUsd: string }[], rateDate: string, provider: string, fetchedAt: Date): Promise<number>;
  currencies(h: DbHandle): Promise<Map<string, { minorUnits: number; active: boolean }>>;
  ```
- **Behaviour:** dates are `YYYY-MM-DD` strings. `insertDay` uses `INSERT … ON CONFLICT (currency_code, rate_date) DO NOTHING` and returns the rows inserted. `numeric` values are read as strings.

#### F-132: `createFxService`
- **File:** `platform/fx/fxService.ts` · **Layer:** service
- **Signatures:**
  ```ts
  export type ConversionResult =
    | { kind: "converted"; money: Money; rateDate: Temporal.PlainDate; provisional: boolean }
    | { kind: "no_rate"; reason: "no_day" | "currency_missing" };
  export type SumResult = { kind: "converted"; total: Money; provisional: boolean } | { kind: "no_rate"; reason: "no_day" | "currency_missing" };
  export class UnknownCurrencyError extends Error {}
  export interface FxService {
    convert(m: Money, to: CurrencyCode, onDate: Temporal.PlainDate, h?: DbHandle): Promise<ConversionResult>;
    convertSum(items: readonly { money: Money; onDate: Temporal.PlainDate }[], to: CurrencyCode, h?: DbHandle): Promise<SumResult>;
    registerRatesAddedSubscriber(def: JobDefinition<RatesAddedPayload>): void;
    subscribers(): readonly JobDefinition<RatesAddedPayload>[];
  }
  export const RatesAddedPayload: z.ZodType<{ rateDate: string; affectedFrom: string; affectedTo: string | null }>;
  export const FX_FALLBACK_FIRST_DATE: "2024-03-02";
  export function createFxService(deps: { database: Database; queue: JobQueue; clock: Clock; logger: Logger; metrics: PlatformMetrics }): FxService;
  ```
- **Behaviour of `convert`** (reads use `h ?? database.handle`; currency metadata is cached per process after the first read):
  1. Either currency not in `currencies` → throws `UnknownCurrencyError`.
  2. Same currency → `{ converted, money: m, rateDate: onDate, provisional: false }`.
  3. `day = latestDayOnOrBefore(onDate)`.
     - **No day** → if `onDate < todayUTC` and `onDate ≥ FX_FALLBACK_FIRST_DATE`, enqueue `platform.fx-backfill { rateDate: onDate }` with `singletonKey = onDate` **outside** the caller's transaction (`database.handle`). Returns `{ no_rate, reason: "no_day" }`.
     - **A day exists** → loads rates for both currencies on `day` (USD is `1` implicitly). If either is missing → `{ no_rate, reason: "currency_missing" }`. Otherwise F-303 `convertWithRates` → `{ converted, rateDate: day, provisional: day !== onDate }`. **When `day < onDate`, `onDate < todayUTC − 1 day`** (the daily job hasn't merely not run yet) **and `onDate ≥ FX_FALLBACK_FIRST_DATE`**, it also enqueues `platform.fx-backfill { rateDate: onDate }` (`singletonKey = onDate`, outside the caller's transaction). Otherwise a past day that both providers missed would stay provisional for ever; a backfill that finds nothing completes with `fx_backfill_missing_total` (F-137).
- **Behaviour of `convertSum`:** converts each item (rounding per item) and sums with F-301. Any `no_rate` makes the whole result `no_rate` with the first reason. `provisional` is the OR over items. An empty `items` → zero in `to`, `provisional: false`.
- **Subscribers:** `registerRatesAddedSubscriber` stores the definition. Each must be registered in the job registry with role `general` and payload `RatesAddedPayload`, or it throws `TypeError`.

#### F-133: providers
- **File:** `platform/fx/providers.ts` · **Layer:** integration
- **Signatures:**
  ```ts
  export type FxProviderName = "openexchangerates" | "fawazahmed0" | "fixed";
  export class FxProviderError extends Error { readonly reason: "not_found" | "http" | "network" | "invalid"; readonly status?: number }
  export interface FxProvider { readonly name: FxProviderName; fetchDay(date: string, signal: AbortSignal): Promise<Map<string, string>> } // upper-case code → raw decimal text
  export interface FxProviders { primary: FxProvider; fallback: FxProvider }
  export function createOpenExchangeRates(cfg: { baseUrl: URL; appId: Secret<string> }, deps: { fetch: typeof fetch }): FxProvider;
  export function createFawazahmed0(cfg: { baseUrl: string; mirrorUrl: string }, deps: { fetch: typeof fetch }): FxProvider;
  export function createFixedProvider(): FxProvider;
  ```
- **Behaviour:**
  - **Open Exchange Rates:** `GET {baseUrl}/historical/{date}.json?app_id=…&base=USD&show_alternative=false`, timeout 10 s.
    - 200 → F-130 parse. The body must be `{ base: "USD", rates: { CODE: number } }`, otherwise `invalid`.
    - 400/404 → `not_found`; other non-2xx → `http` with status; network → `network`.
  - **fawazahmed0:** `GET {baseUrl with {date}}/currencies/usd.json`; on `network` or 5xx, retries once on `{mirrorUrl with {date}}/currencies/usd.json`.
    - 200 → parse `{ date, usd: { eur: n, … } }`; `date` must equal the requested date (else `invalid`); keys are upper-cased.
    - 404 → `not_found`.
  - **Fixed:** returns `USD 1`, `EUR 0.92`, `GBP 0.79`, `EGP 48.5`, `JPY 149.25`, `KWD 0.307`, `SAR 3.75` for any date.
  - URLs in logs and spans pass through F-37.

#### F-137: FX jobs
- **File:** `platform/fx/fxJobs.ts`
- **Definitions:**
  - `platform.fx-rates-fetch`: general, `cron "30 0 * * *"`, payload `z.object({})`, `retryLimit 14`, `retryDelaySeconds 1800`, `retryBackoff false`, `expireInSeconds 300`, `policy "singleton"`.
  - `platform.fx-backfill`: general, payload `z.object({ rateDate: isoDate })`, `retryLimit 5`, `retryBackoff true`, `expireInSeconds 300`, `policy "short"`.
- **Behaviour, fetch:**
  1. `rateDate = utcDateOf(ctx.createdOn) − 1 day`, so retries keep the same day. If `dayExists(rateDate)`, complete.
  2. `elapsed = now − ctx.createdOn`; provider = primary if `elapsed < 6 h`, else fallback.
  3. `fetchDay`, keeping codes that are **active** in `currencies`, each through F-130 `normaliseRate`. Rejected codes increment `fx_rates_rejected_total{provider}`.
  4. Zero valid rows → throws `FxProviderError("invalid")`.
  5. In one transaction: F-131 `insertDay`, then F-138.
  6. Increments `fx_rates_fetched_total{provider}` and logs `info("fx_day_stored", { rateDate, provider, inserted, rejected })`.
- **Behaviour, backfill:**
  - `dayExists` → complete.
  - Fallback provider. `not_found` → increments `fx_backfill_missing_total`, logs `info("fx_backfill_missing", { rateDate })` and completes (no throw).
  - Other provider errors throw (retry).
  - Success → the same insert path with provider `fawazahmed0`.
- **Errors:** `FxProviderError` → job retry; the stored output is the sanitised class and code (F-76).

#### F-138: `enqueueRatesAdded`
- **File:** `platform/fx/fxJobs.ts`
- **Signature:** `export async function enqueueRatesAdded(h: DbHandle, fx: FxService, queue: JobQueue, rateDate: string): Promise<number>`
- **Behaviour:** `next = nextStoredDayAfter(rateDate)`; `affectedTo = next ? next − 1 day : null`. For each subscriber, `queue.enqueue(h, def, { rateDate, affectedFrom: rateDate, affectedTo })`. Returns the count. Runs in the inserting transaction.

#### F-139: FX gap check
- **File:** `platform/fx/fxJobs.ts`
- **Definition:** `platform.fx-gap-check`: general, `cron "45 6 * * *"`, payload `z.object({})`, `policy "singleton"`, `retryLimit 3`. It's also enqueued once by F-78 when a general-role worker starts (`singletonKey "startup"`), because pg-boss doesn't replay cron runs missed while the laptop was off (HLD D-15, D-29).
- **Signature of the handler core:** `export async function fxGapCheck(deps: { database: Database; queue: JobQueue; clock: Clock; logger: Logger }): Promise<{ enqueued: string[] }>`
- **Behaviour:**
  1. `yesterday = utcDateOf(now) − 1 day`; `latest = latestDayOnOrBefore(yesterday)` (F-131).
  2. If `latest` is null (empty table), enqueue nothing (the daily fetch establishes the first day).
  3. Otherwise, for each date `d` from `latest + 1` to `yesterday`, at most the **31 most recent**: enqueue `platform.fx-backfill { rateDate: d }` with `singletonKey = d` (autocommit).
  4. Returns the dates and logs `info("fx_gap_check", { count })`.
  - Yesterday's date is included, so a missed daily fetch is caught up the same way. The fetch job's own retries still apply when it does run.

### 4.12 Object storage and the erasure log (S-10)

#### F-140: `ObjectStore`
- **File:** `platform/storage/objectStore.ts`
- **Signatures:**
  ```ts
  export type BucketName = "exports" | "erasure-log";
  export class ObjectStoreError extends Error { readonly reason: "not_found" | "denied" | "unavailable" }
  export interface ObjectStore {
    put(bucket: BucketName, key: string, body: Buffer, contentType: string): Promise<void>;
    delete(bucket: BucketName, key: string): Promise<void>;          // missing key: no error
    deletePrefix(bucket: BucketName, prefix: string): Promise<number>;
    list(bucket: BucketName, prefix: string): AsyncIterable<{ key: string; lastModified: Temporal.Instant }>;
    presignGet(bucket: BucketName, key: string, ttlSeconds?: number, opts?: PresignGetOptions): Promise<URL>; // ttl 60..900, default 900; opts: A-22
  }
  export interface PresignGetOptions { downloadName?: string }       // A-22: the file name the browser saves
  export function assertObjectKey(bucket: BucketName, key: string): void;
  ```
- **Key rules:**
  - `exports`: `^users/[0-9a-f-]{36}/exports/[0-9a-f-]{36}\.(csv|json|zip)$`.
  - `erasure-log`: `^records/\d{8}T\d{6}Z_[0-9a-f-]{36}\.json$`.
  - Prefixes must match `^users/[0-9a-f-]{36}/$`, `^users/$` or `^records/$`.
- **`downloadName` (A-22):** must match `^[A-Za-z0-9._-]{1,100}$`. Each implementation puts it into the download's `Content-Disposition` as `attachment; filename="<downloadName>"`; without it the header is `attachment`.
- **Errors:** an invalid key or prefix throws `RangeError`. A `ttlSeconds` outside 60..900 throws `RangeError`. A `downloadName` not matching its pattern throws `RangeError`. All three are checked before any I/O.

#### F-141: `createS3ObjectStore`
- **File:** `platform/storage/s3ObjectStore.ts` · **Layer:** integration
- **Signature:** `export function createS3ObjectStore(cfg: Extract<Config["objectStore"], { kind: "s3" }>, deps?: { client?: S3Client /* [inj] */ }): ObjectStore`
- **Behaviour:**
  - AWS SDK v3 `S3Client({ endpoint, region, credentials, requestChecksumCalculation: "WHEN_REQUIRED" })`; the logical bucket is mapped to its configured name.
  - `deletePrefix` lists with `ListObjectsV2` (1000 per page) and deletes with `DeleteObjects`.
  - `presignGet` uses `getSignedUrl(client, new GetObjectCommand({ Bucket, Key, ResponseContentDisposition }), { expiresIn })`, with `ResponseContentDisposition` = `'attachment; filename="<downloadName>"'` when `opts.downloadName` is given, else `"attachment"` (A-22). The URL carries it as the signed `response-content-disposition` parameter.
- **Errors:** SDK `NoSuchKey`/404 → `ObjectStoreError("not_found")`; 403 → `"denied"`; network or 5xx → `"unavailable"`.

#### F-142: `createFsObjectStore`
- **File:** `platform/storage/fsObjectStore.ts` (development)
- **Signature:** `export function createFsObjectStore(cfg: { root: string; publicOrigin: URL; signingKey: Buffer; clock: Clock }): ObjectStore`
- **Behaviour:**
  - Files live at `<root>/<bucket>/<key>`; `lastModified` is the file's mtime.
  - `presignGet` returns `<publicOrigin>/dev/objects/<token>`, where `token = base64url(canonicalJson({ b, k, exp, n })) + "." + base64url(hmacSha256(signingKey, payloadPart))`. `n` is `opts.downloadName`; the key is omitted (not `null`) when no name is given (A-22).

#### F-143: `createMemoryObjectStore`
- **File:** `platform/storage/memoryObjectStore.ts`
- **Signature:** `export function createMemoryObjectStore(clock: Clock): ObjectStore & { snapshot(): ReadonlyMap<string, { body: Buffer; lastModified: Temporal.Instant }> }`
- **Behaviour:** an in-memory fake with the same validation and error behaviour. `presignGet` returns `memory://<bucket>/<key>?exp=<epoch>`, plus `&n=<downloadName>` when `opts.downloadName` is given (A-22); tests read the name from the URL's `n` parameter. Nothing else records it.

#### F-144: exports purge
- **File:** `platform/storage/exportsPurge.ts`
- **Signature:** `export async function purgeExpiredExports(deps: { store: ObjectStore; clock: Clock; logger: Logger }): Promise<number>`
- **Behaviour:** lists `exports` under `users/` and deletes objects whose `lastModified < now − 7 days`. Returns the count and logs `info("exports_purged", { count })`.

#### F-145: development objects route
- **File:** `platform/http/devObjects.ts`
- **Signature:** `export function registerDevObjectsRoute(app: FastifyInstance, deps: { root: string; signingKey: Buffer; clock: Clock }): void`
- **Behaviour:** registered only when `APP_ENV=development`. `GET /dev/objects/:token` verifies the HMAC (constant time) and `exp ≥ now`, then streams the file with `Cache-Control: no-store` and `Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="<n>"` when the payload has `n`, else `Content-Disposition: attachment` (A-22). An `n` that doesn't match F-140's `downloadName` pattern is a failure (checked after the HMAC). Any failure → `404` with the platform `NOT_FOUND` envelope.

#### F-146: `ErasureLog`
- **File:** `platform/storage/erasureLog.ts`
- **Signatures:**
  ```ts
  export interface ErasureRecord { userId: string; erasedAt: Temporal.Instant }
  export interface ErasureLog { append(r: ErasureRecord): Promise<void>; listSince(since: Temporal.Instant): Promise<ErasureRecord[]> }
  export type ErasureHandler = (userId: string) => Promise<void>;
  export function createErasureLog(store: ObjectStore): ErasureLog;
  ```
- **Behaviour:**
  - `append` writes `records/<erasedAt as YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ>_<userId>.json` with body `canonicalJson({ userId, erasedAt: erasedAt.toString() })`, `application/json`.
  - `listSince` lists `records/` and returns records with `erasedAt ≥ since`, read from the key name (parsed; the body isn't needed), sorted by `erasedAt` and then `userId`.
  - `identity` provides the `ErasureHandler` through the container (`WorkerContainer.erasureHandler: ErasureHandler | null`, default `null`, declared in F-96 by A-26).
- **Errors:** `put` failures propagate (`identity` stops the erasure before deleting anything, HLD D-30).

### 4.13 Operations commands (S-10)

#### F-150: `verifyRestore`
- **File:** `platform/ops/restoreVerify.ts`
- **Signature:** `export interface RestoreReport { ok: boolean; schema: "ok" | "behind" | "ahead" | "not_migrated"; amcheck: { indexesChecked: number; failures: { index: string; code: string }[] }; tables: { schema: string; table: string; rows: number }[] }; export async function verifyRestore(deps: { database: Database; journal: readonly { hash: string; when: number }[] }): Promise<RestoreReport>`
- **Behaviour:**
  1. `schema`: F-57 `schemaWindow` against the migrations table (`not_migrated` if it's absent).
  2. For every B-tree index in schemas `public` and `pgboss`: `SELECT bt_index_check(index => $oid, heapallindexed => true)`. An error records `{ index: <name>, code: <SQLSTATE> }`.
  3. Exact `count(*)` for every table in `public` and `pgboss`.
  - `ok = schema === "ok" && failures.length === 0`.
  - Run as `budmon_migrator`, which F-14 grants `EXECUTE ON FUNCTION bt_index_check(regclass, boolean)` and `pg_read_all_data` membership.
- **Errors:** database errors propagate (CLI exit 1).

#### F-151: `replayErasures`
- **File:** `platform/ops/erasureReplay.ts`
- **Signature:** `export class NoErasureHandlerError extends Error {}; export async function replayErasures(deps: { log: ErasureLog; handler: ErasureHandler | null; logger: Logger }, since: Temporal.Instant): Promise<{ replayed: number }>`
- **Behaviour:** lists the records since `since` and calls the handler for each, in order. Handlers are idempotent (`identity`'s requirement). Logs `info("erasure_replayed", { count })`.
- **Errors:** records exist and the handler is null → `NoErasureHandlerError`. A handler failure is logged with `replayed` so far and rethrown.

#### F-160: server message rendering
- **File:** `apps/server/src/i18n/render.ts`
- **Signatures:** `export function renderMessage(locale: string, id: string, values?: Record<string, string | number>): string`; `export function createMessageRenderer(catalogs: Readonly<Record<string, Readonly<Record<string, string>>>>): typeof renderMessage` (A-126; `en` required, else `TypeError`); `renderMessage` = `createMessageRenderer(<shipped catalogs>)`.
- **Behaviour:** resolves the locale with F-312 against the catalogs present in `apps/server/src/i18n/messages/`, then formats with `@formatjs/intl`'s `createIntl`. String values are wrapped with F-312 `isolate`.
- **Errors:** an id that isn't in the `en` catalogue throws `Error("unknown message id")` (a programming error).

### 4.14 Contract package `@budmon/contract` (S-4)

#### F-340: money and common wire schemas
- **File:** `packages/contract/src/common/money.ts`, `dates.ts`, `ids.ts`
- **Signatures:**
  ```ts
  export const MoneyAmount: z.ZodNumber;            // z.number().int().min(-9007199254740991).max(9007199254740991)
  export const CurrencyCodeSchema: z.ZodString;     // regex ^[A-Z]{3}$
  export const MoneySchema: z.ZodObject<{ amount: typeof MoneyAmount; currency: typeof CurrencyCodeSchema }>;
  export const PlainDateWire: z.ZodString;          // ^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}$ + refine(valid calendar date)
  export const InstantWire: z.ZodString;            // RFC 3339 with "Z", e.g. 2026-10-05T12:00:00.000Z
  export const UuidSchema: z.ZodString;             // A-153, A-169: z.string().regex(UUID_PATTERN), registered with JSON_SCHEMA_REGISTRY.add(UuidSchema, { format: "uuid", pattern: UUID_PATTERN.source }); UUID_PATTERN copies F-311's (drift test TP-4.28)
  ```
- **Behaviour:** `MoneyAmount` is registered in `@orpc/zod/zod4`'s `JSON_SCHEMA_REGISTRY` with `{ type: "integer", format: "int64", minimum: -9007199254740991, maximum: 9007199254740991 }`, so input and output are emitted identically. No `.transform()` anywhere in the contract.

#### F-341: API version
- **File:** `packages/contract/src/common/version.ts`
- **Signature:** `export const API_MAJOR = 1; export const API_MINOR: number; export const API_VERSION: \`1.${number}\``
- **Behaviour:** `API_MINOR` starts at `0` and is bumped by any pull request that changes `openapi.json` (F-8).

#### F-342: platform errors in the contract
- **File:** `packages/contract/src/common/errors.ts`
- **Signatures:** `export const IssueSchema`, `export const OutcomeSchema = z.enum(["not_applied", "unknown"])`, `export const PLATFORM_ERRORS` (an oRPC error map), and `export const base = oc.errors(PLATFORM_ERRORS)`. Every procedure is built from `base`.
- **Error map:**

  | Key | Status | `data` schema |
  | --- | ------ | ------------- |
  | `VALIDATION_FAILED` | 400 | `{ issues: Issue[] }` |
  | `CLIENT_UPDATE_REQUIRED` | 400 | `{ minimumVersion: int }` |
  | `UNAUTHENTICATED` | 401 | none |
  | `FORBIDDEN` | 403 | none |
  | `NOT_FOUND` | 404 | none |
  | `CONFLICT` | 409 | `Record<string, string>`, optional |
  | `IDEMPOTENCY_KEY_REUSED` | 409 | none |
  | `PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE` | 413 | none |
  | `RATE_LIMITED` | 429 | `{ retryAfterSeconds: int ≥ 1 }` |
  | `INTERNAL` | 500 | `{ outcome }` |
  | `SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE` | 503 | `{ outcome }`, optional |

#### F-343: create procedures
- **File:** `packages/contract/src/common/create.ts`
- **Signatures:** `export const CreatedResultSchema = z.object({ id: UuidSchema, createdAt: InstantWire })`; `export function createRoute(path: \`/${string}\`): ProcedureBuilder` returns `base.route({ method: "POST", path, successStatus: 201, spec: addIdempotencyKeyHeader }).meta({ kind: "create" }).output(CreatedResultSchema)`.
- **Behaviour:** `addIdempotencyKeyHeader(operation)` adds a required header parameter `Idempotency-Key` (`string`, `format: uuid`) and the extension `x-budmon-kind: create` to the OpenAPI operation.

#### F-344: list schemas
- **File:** `packages/contract/src/common/cursor.ts`
- **Signatures:** `export const CursorSchema = z.string().max(512).meta({ "x-budmon-cursor": true })`; `export function listInput<F extends z.ZodRawShape>(filters: F)` returns `z.object({ ...filters, cursor: CursorSchema.optional(), limit: z.number().int().min(1).max(100).default(50) })`; `export function listOutput<T extends z.ZodTypeAny>(item: T)` returns `z.object({ items: z.array(item), nextCursor: CursorSchema.nullable() })`.

#### F-345: meta contract
- **File:** `packages/contract/src/meta/metaContract.ts`
- **Signature:** `export const metaContract = { clientConfig: base.route({ method: "GET", path: "/meta/client-config" }).output(ClientConfigSchema) }`, where `ClientConfigSchema = z.object({ apiVersion: z.string().regex(/^1\.\d+$/), android: z.object({ minimumVersionCode: z.number().int().min(0), latestVersionCode: z.number().int().min(0), downloadUrl: z.url().nullable() }), web: z.object({ minimumBuild: z.number().int().min(0) }) })`.

#### F-346: contract root
- **File:** `packages/contract/src/index.ts`
- **Signature:** `export const contract = { meta: metaContract /* modules add their keys */ }`; also re-exports F-340 to F-345 and F-349 `listProcedures` (A-143). `UuidSchema` and `CursorSchema` are registered in oRPC's JSON-schema registry as named components (A-143). `@orpc/server` is a dependency of `@budmon/contract` (peer of `@orpc/zod`).

#### F-347: `emitOpenapi`
- **File:** `packages/contract/scripts/emitOpenapi.ts` (`pnpm contract:openapi`)
- **Signature:** `export async function emitOpenapi(): Promise<string>`, which returns the JSON text; the script writes it to `packages/contract/openapi.json`.
- **Behaviour:** `new OpenAPIGenerator({ schemaConverters: [new ZodToJsonSchemaConverter()] }).generate(contract, { info: { title: "Budmon API", version: API_VERSION }, servers: [{ url: "/api/v1" }] })`. Output is serialised with keys sorted recursively, 2-space indentation and a trailing newline, so it's deterministic.

#### F-348: `checkContractRules`
- **File:** `packages/contract/src/rules/contractRules.ts`
- **Signature:** `export interface Violation { rule: string; location: string }; export function checkContractRules(doc: OpenAPIV3_1.Document): Violation[]`
- **Rules** (`location` = JSON pointer):
  - **Scope (A-143):** R1 and R3 apply to request bodies and 2xx response bodies only (error envelopes are fixed by §5.1/F-342).
  - **R1:** no schema in a request or response body is `{}` or lacks `type`, `$ref`, `anyOf`, `oneOf`, `allOf`, `enum` and `const` (catches `.transform()` and untyped schemas).
  - **R2:** every `type: "integer"` with `format: "int64"` has `minimum` and `maximum`.
  - **R3:** no `type: "number"` anywhere without `x-budmon-allow-number: true` (money is integer only).
  - **R4:** `GET` operations have no request body. Each query or path parameter schema is one of: `format: uuid`; `enum`; `format: date` (or `PlainDateWire`'s pattern); `type: integer`; `type: boolean`; or a string with `x-budmon-cursor: true`. On every operation other than `GET`, path parameters are string schemas (`format: uuid`, `enum` or a date pattern), because only `GET` is coerced (A-165, A-173, A-175). A `DELETE` has no query parameters and no request body (A-173).
  - **R5:** every operation with `x-budmon-kind: create` has a required `Idempotency-Key` header parameter and a `201` response whose schema is `CreatedResult`.
  - **R6:** operation IDs are unique.

#### F-349: `listProcedures`
- **File:** `packages/contract/src/rules/listProcedures.ts`
- **Signature:** `export function listProcedures(c: AnyContractRouter, prefix?: string): { path: string; method: string; route: string }[]`
- **Behaviour:** walks the router and returns the dotted path (e.g. `meta.clientConfig`), HTTP method and OpenAPI path for every procedure. `prefix` (default `""`) is prepended with a `.` to every dotted path, for listing a sub-router under its key (`listProcedures(contract.meta, "meta")` → `meta.clientConfig`) (A-127). Used by the default-deny test and F-348's tests.

### 4.15 Images and the stage-0 laptop stack (S-15)

Stage 0 runs on the owner's Windows laptop (HLD D-29 v1.1): Docker Desktop with the WSL2 backend, and the repository and every command inside WSL2. All server-deployment machinery (deploy bundles, bootstrap and trust anchors, forced-command SSH, cloud-init, OpenTofu for servers, signing, Alloy, pgBackRest scheduling, alert rules) is specified in the stage-1 LLD. The functions that v0.5 numbered F-171 to F-174, F-176 and F-177 now belong there.

#### F-170: Postgres image entrypoint
- **File:** `images/postgres/budmon-entrypoint.sh` (bash), `images/postgres/Dockerfile`
- **Image:** `FROM postgres:18-bookworm@sha256:<digest>`.
  - Adds `pgbackrest` (PGDG apt, pinned). It's unused on the laptop but installed from the first release, because the image must be identical in stages 0 and 1 (D-29 rule 1). `pg_stat_statements` and `amcheck` ship with the base image's contrib.
  - Copies `apps/server/src/platform/db/sql/cluster-bootstrap.sql` to `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/10-budmon.sql.tpl`, plus `10-budmon.sh`.
  - Runs as user `postgres` (uid 999).
- **Behaviour** (CLI `budmon-entrypoint.sh postgres [args]`):
  1. `PGDATA` must equal `/var/lib/postgresql/data/pgdata`. If `/var/lib/postgresql/data` isn't a mount point (`mountpoint -q`), print `Refusing to start: data mount missing` and exit 70.
  2. If `$PGDATA/PG_VERSION` is missing:
     - `BUDMON_FIRST_SETUP=1` → run the upstream `docker-entrypoint.sh` initialisation with `POSTGRES_USER=budmon_admin`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD_FILE=/run/secrets/ADMIN_PASSWORD` and `POSTGRES_DB=postgres`. `10-budmon.sh` runs the bootstrap SQL with `psql -v migrator_verifier="$(cat /run/secrets/MIGRATOR_VERIFIER)" -v dbname=budmon`.
     - Otherwise print `Refusing to initialise an empty data directory without BUDMON_FIRST_SETUP=1` and exit 70.
  3. Otherwise `exec docker-entrypoint.sh postgres -c config_file=/etc/budmon/postgresql.conf -c hba_file=/etc/budmon/pg_hba.conf -c ident_file=/etc/budmon/pg_ident.conf`, the three files mounted read-only. These are the **only** start-up arguments; CI's image tests and the rehearsal use the laptop's Compose file, not their own command line.
  - **`ADMIN_PASSWORD`** is needed only because the upstream entrypoint requires a superuser password at `initdb`. Afterwards `budmon_admin` logs in only by `peer` over the socket. The password stays in the Postgres secret directory as a break-glass value.
- **Configuration** (`infra/local/postgres/postgresql.conf`, mounted read-only):
  - **Logging (D-24 rule 8):** `log_error_verbosity = terse`, `log_min_error_statement = panic`, `log_statement = none`, `log_parameter_max_length = 0`, `log_parameter_max_length_on_error = 0`, `log_destination = stderr`.
  - **Connections and TLS:** `password_encryption = scram-sha-256`, `ssl = on` with `ssl_cert_file`/`ssl_key_file` = `/run/secrets/TLS_CERT` and `/run/secrets/TLS_KEY`, `listen_addresses = '${BUDMON_LISTEN_ADDRESSES}'` (through `-c` from Compose), `max_connections = 100`.
  - **WAL and archiving:** `wal_level = replica`, **`archive_mode = off`** (no off-site backups in stage 0, D-30).
  - **Extensions:** `shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_stat_statements'`, `pg_stat_statements.track_utility = off` (F-15).
  - `shared_buffers = 512MB`.
- `pg_ident.conf` (`infra/local/postgres/pg_ident.conf`): `local_admin postgres budmon_admin`.

#### F-175: the laptop's Compose files and configuration
- **Files:** `infra/local/compose.main.yaml`, `infra/local/compose.capture.yaml`, `infra/local/local.env`, `infra/local/Caddyfile`, `infra/local/postgres/{postgresql.conf,pg_hba.conf,pg_ident.conf}`.
- **`local.env`** (non-secret, committed, copied with the release):
  - `EDGE_SUBNET=172.30.41.0/24`, `CADDY_EDGE_IP=172.30.41.2`, `TRUSTED_PROXY=172.30.41.2` (passed to `api`: Fastify trusts only Caddy, D-22);
  - `DATA_SUBNET=172.30.40.0/24`, `PG_DATA_IP=172.30.40.10`;
  - `CAPTURE_DB_SUBNET=172.30.42.0/29`, `PG_CAPTURE_IP=172.30.42.2`, `WORKER_CAPTURE_IP=172.30.42.4`;
  - `APP_ENV=production`, `KMS_PROVIDER=gcp`, `FX_PROVIDER=live`, `OBJECT_STORE_KIND=s3`, `DB_NAME=budmon`, `DB_PORT=5432`;
  - `GOOGLE_OAUTH_REDIRECT_ORIGIN=http://localhost:8080` (Gmail is connected from the laptop's browser, HLD D-29 and A-16).
- **`site.env`** (`${BUDMON_HOME}/site.env`, mode 0600, never committed; written by F-178 `install` step 6, and `CAPTURE_KEY_VERSION` by F-179):

  | Key | Prompt and default | Validation at the prompt |
  | --- | ------------------ | ------------------------ |
  | `PUBLIC_ORIGIN` | "Tailscale name of this laptop" → `https://<answer>` | `^[a-z0-9-]+\.[a-z0-9-]+\.ts\.net$` |
  | `CAPTURE_KEY_VERSION` | not asked; `__FILL_ME__` until F-179 | |
  | `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` | "Google OAuth client id" | ends in `.apps.googleusercontent.com`, or blank → `__FILL_ME__` |
  | `S3_ENDPOINT` | default `https://s3.eu-central-003.backblazeb2.com` | `https://` URL |
  | `S3_REGION` | default `eu-central-003` | non-empty |
  | `S3_BUCKET_EXPORTS` | default `budmon-exports` | B2 bucket-name rules |
  | `S3_BUCKET_ERASURE_LOG` | default `budmon-erasure-log` | same |
  | `SENTRY_DSN` | "Sentry DSN for budmon-server" | `https://` URL, or blank → `__FILL_ME__` |
  | `GOOGLE_SIGNIN_CLIENT_ID` (A-3) | "Google sign-in client id (the \"Budmon sign-in\" web client)" | ends in `.apps.googleusercontent.com`, or blank → `__FILL_ME__` |
  | `GOOGLE_SIGNIN_ANDROID_CLIENT_IDS` (A-3) | "Android sign-in client ids, comma-separated (optional)" | blank allowed (written empty) |
  | `GOOGLE_SIGNIN_CALLBACK_ORIGIN` (A-3) | default `http://localhost:8080` | `http://localhost:<port>` or `https://` origin |
  | `GOOGLE_SIGNIN_APP_ORIGINS` (A-3) | default `${PUBLIC_ORIGIN},http://localhost:8080` | comma list of origins |
  | `SMTP_URL` (A-2) | default `smtp://mailpit:1025` (the laptop's Mailpit); or a relay such as `smtp://user@smtp.gmail.com:587` | F-10's `SMTP_URL` rule |
  | `EMAIL_FROM` (A-2) | default `Budmon <no-reply@budmon.local>` | RFC 5322 mailbox |

- **Environment per service.** Both Compose files use `env_file: [local.env, ${BUDMON_HOME}/site.env]`, and every application service also sets `BUDMON_RELEASE=${BUDMON_TAG}` and, for each file in its secret directory, `<KEY>_FILE=/run/secrets/<KEY>` (for example `DB_PASSWORD_FILE=/run/secrets/DB_PASSWORD`). Per service: `api`: `DB_HOST=postgres`, `DB_USER=budmon_app`, `HOST=0.0.0.0`, `PORT=3000`; `worker-general`: `DB_HOST=postgres`, `DB_USER=budmon_app`, `QUEUE_DB_USER=budmon_queue`, `WORKER_ROLES=general`; `migrate`: `DB_HOST=postgres`, `DB_USER=budmon_migrator`; `worker-capture`: below. TP-15.27 checks that this yields a valid configuration for every service.
- **Main project** (`budmon-main`). Every application service runs `read_only: true`, `tmpfs: [/tmp]`, `cap_drop: [ALL]`, `security_opt: [no-new-privileges:true]`, its own non-root UID through Compose `user:` (api 10001, worker-general 10002, worker-capture 10003, migrate 10004, caddy 10005), and `restart: unless-stopped`. `stop_grace_period`: `api` 15s, `worker-general` and `worker-capture` 45s (A-180). Images are `budmon/<image>:<tag>`, built locally by F-178.

  | Service | Image | Networks | Memory | Notes |
  | ------- | ----- | -------- | ------ | ----- |
  | `caddy` | web | `edge` (`ipv4_address: CADDY_EDGE_IP`) | 128m | Port `127.0.0.1:8080:8080` (published to Windows' localhost by Docker Desktop; never to the LAN). Mounts: `${BUDMON_HOME}/maintenance:/srv/maintenance:ro`, `Caddyfile:ro`. |
  | `api` | server, `node --import ./dist/main/instrument.js dist/main/api.js` (A-147) | `edge`, `data`, `egress` | 512m | Secrets: `${BUDMON_HOME}/secrets/main/api:/run/secrets:ro`. |
  | `worker-general` | server, `node --import ./dist/main/instrument.js dist/main/worker.js` (A-147), `WORKER_ROLES=general` | `data`, `egress` | 384m | Secrets: `…/main/worker-general`. |
  | `postgres` | postgres | `data` (`ipv4_address: PG_DATA_IP`), `capture-db` (`PG_CAPTURE_IP`) | 1g | Bind mount `${BUDMON_HOME}/pg:/var/lib/postgresql/data` with `bind.create_host_path: false`. `BUDMON_LISTEN_ADDRESSES=${PG_DATA_IP},${PG_CAPTURE_IP}`. No published port. Secrets: `…/main/postgres`. |
  | `migrate` | server, `node dist/main/migrate.js` | `data` | 256m | Profile `tools`. Secrets: `…/main/migrate`. |
  | `mailpit` (A-2) | `axllent/mailpit` (pinned by digest) | `data` (SMTP on 1025, reached by worker-general as `mailpit`), `mail-ui` (project-local bridge) | 128m | `command: ["--quiet"]`; `logging: { driver: "none" }`, so no address reaches Docker's logs; web inbox published on `127.0.0.1:8025:8025` only; user 10006; no secrets; `restart: unless-stopped`. |

  Networks: `edge` (bridge, subnet `EDGE_SUBNET`); `data` (`internal: true`, subnet `DATA_SUBNET`); `egress` (bridge); `mail-ui` (bridge, only so Mailpit's inbox port can be published; A-2); `capture-db` (external, `budmon_capture_db`, created by F-178 with `--internal --subnet ${CAPTURE_DB_SUBNET}`). `api` joins `egress` to reach Sentry and, from A-3, Google's token and JWKS endpoints (`oauth2.googleapis.com`, `www.googleapis.com`).
- **Capture project** (`budmon-capture`): `worker-capture` (server, `node --import ./dist/main/instrument.js dist/main/worker.js` (A-147), `WORKER_ROLES=capture`, 384m, `restart: unless-stopped`) on `capture-db` (`ipv4_address: WORKER_CAPTURE_IP`) and `capture-egress` (bridge, project-local). Settings:
  - `extra_hosts: db.budmon.internal:${PG_CAPTURE_IP}`;
  - `DB_HOST=db.budmon.internal`, `DB_USER=budmon_capture`, `WORKER_ROLES=capture`, `DB_SSLMODE=verify-full`, `DB_SSL_ROOT_CERT_FILE=/run/secrets/DB_CA_CERT`;
  - secrets `${BUDMON_HOME}/secrets/capture/worker-capture:/run/secrets:ro`;
  - no proxy variables and no OTLP endpoint.
- **`pg_hba.conf`:**
  ```

  ```
- **Health checks:** the server image has a `healthcheck` entry (`apps/server/src/main/healthcheck.ts`, run as `node dist/main/healthcheck.js`; delivered in S-6):
  - `--heartbeat` (the workers' Compose `healthcheck`) parses the epoch seconds in `/tmp/heartbeat` (written by F-79; the content, not the mtime, A-208) and exits 0 if they're less than 60 s old, otherwise 1 (unreadable or non-numeric → 1);
  - `--ready` (api) requests `http://127.0.0.1:${PORT}/health/ready` (`PORT` from the environment, default 3000, A-208) with a 2 s timeout and exits 0 on 200, otherwise 1.

  Compose: `interval: 15s`, `retries: 4`. F-178 checks readiness with `docker compose exec -T api node dist/main/healthcheck.js --ready`, directly against the API rather than through Caddy, because Caddy answers 503 while the maintenance flag exists.
- **Caddyfile** (`infra/local/Caddyfile`):
  - Global options `auto_https off`; site `:8080`. TLS is terminated by Tailscale Serve on Windows (F-178 `install` prints the command).
  - `log` and the default logger use `format filter` with `request>uri regexp "\?.*$" ""`, `request>headers delete`, `resp_headers delete` and `request>remote_ip ip_mask 24 64`.
  - `@maint file /srv/maintenance/on`.
  - `handle /api/*`:
    - with `@maint`, `respond` 503, `Content-Type: application/json`, `Retry-After: 120`, body `{"defined":true,"code":"SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE","status":503,"message":"Service unavailable","data":{"outcome":"not_applied"}}`;
    - otherwise `reverse_proxy api:3000 { lb_try_duration 10s  lb_try_interval 250ms }`.
  - `handle /health/ready`: with `@maint`, `respond {"status":"maintenance"} 503`; otherwise proxy to `api`.
  - `handle /version.json`: `file_server` with `Cache-Control: no-store`.
  - `handle`: `root /srv/web`, `try_files {path} /index.html`, `file_server`; `/assets/*` gets `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable`.
  - Headers on all responses: `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000`, `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self'; img-src 'self' data:; font-src 'self'; connect-src 'self' https://*.ingest.de.sentry.io https://*.ingest.sentry.io; frame-ancestors 'none'; base-uri 'none'; form-action 'self'`.

#### F-178: `budmon-local`
- **Files:** `infra/local/budmon-local` (bash 5, `set -euo pipefail`; runs in WSL2 or any Linux), `infra/local/lib/{common,secrets,release,stack}.sh`.
- **Layout under `BUDMON_HOME`** (default `~/.budmon`; created mode 0700, owned by the WSL user unless stated):

  | Path | Owner | Mode | Content |
  | ---- | ----- | ---- | ------- |
  | `state` | WSL user | 0600 | `current=<tag>`, `previous=<tag or empty>` |
  | `install.inprogress` | WSL user | 0600 | `tag=<tag>`; exists only between install step 11 and a successful first start. |
  | `site.env` | WSL user | 0600 | The laptop's non-secret settings (F-175). |
  | `secrets/`, `secrets/main/`, `secrets/capture/` | WSL user | 0700 | Parents only; `secrets/.initialised` is F-191's marker. |
  | `secrets/main/api/` | 10001:10001 | dir 0500, files 0400 | api's files (F-191 table). |
  | `secrets/main/worker-general/` | 10002:10002 | dir 0500, files 0400 | |
  | `secrets/capture/worker-capture/` | 10003:10003 | dir 0500, files 0400 | |
  | `secrets/main/migrate/` | 10004:10004 | dir 0500, files 0400 | |
  | `secrets/main/postgres/` | 999:999 | dir 0500, files 0400 | Includes `TLS_KEY` (Postgres accepts a key owned by its user with no group or other access). |
  | `pg/` | 999:999 | 0700 | The Postgres data directory. |
  | `ca/` | WSL user | 0700 | `ca.key` (0400), `ca.crt` (0444). |
  | `maintenance/` | WSL user | 0755 | The flag `on` (0644). |
  | `dumps/` | WSL user | 0700 | `<UTC yyyymmddThhmmssZ>_<tag>.dump` (0600). |
  | `releases/<tag>/` | WSL user | dirs 0755, files 0644, `budmon-local` 0755 | A copy of that tag's `infra/local/` without `test/` and `rehearsal/`, plus `RELEASE` (`tag=<tag>`, `commit=<sha>`). |
  | `build/<tag>/` | WSL user | | A temporary `git worktree` of the tag; removed after the build. |
  | `bin/budmon-local` | WSL user | symlink | → `releases/<state.current>/budmon-local`. The runbook adds `~/.budmon/bin` to `PATH`. |

  The ownership rows are applied by `apply_secret_ownership` (`lib/secrets.sh`), which runs `sudo chown -R <uid>:<uid>`, `sudo chmod 0500` on the directory and `sudo chmod 0400` on its files for each service directory. The UIDs are the Compose `user:` values (F-175); bind mounts keep the host's numeric ownership. Writing as the WSL user needs `sudo`, which the runbook's Ubuntu user has.
- **Which files a command uses (release copies).** Production never runs infrastructure files from the working clone:
  - Every Compose call is `docker compose --project-directory "$R" -p <project> -f "$R/compose.<project>.yaml" --env-file "$R/local.env"` with `BUDMON_TAG=<tag>` and `BUDMON_HOME` exported, where `R = ${BUDMON_HOME}/releases/<tag>`. `<tag>` is `state.current`, except where a command says otherwise.
  - **Re-execution rule:** on start, if `state` exists, the command isn't `install`, `upgrade` (phase A) or `_upgrade-continue`, and `realpath "$0"` isn't `releases/<state.current>/budmon-local`, the script runs `exec releases/<state.current>/budmon-local "$@"` with `BUDMON_REEXEC=1`. If `BUDMON_REEXEC=1` is already set and the paths still differ, exit 3 (`release copy mismatch`).
  - `install` and `upgrade` may be run from the clone (`~/src/budmon/infra/local/budmon-local`) or from `bin/`. They read the repository from `BUDMON_REPO` (default `~/src/budmon`), never its working tree.
- **Commands:**

  | Command | Behaviour | Exit |
  | ------- | --------- | ---- |
  | `install <tag>` | Resumable; each step is skipped when its result exists. (1) Exit 2 if `state` exists. If `pg/` isn't empty and there's no `install.inprogress` marker, exit 2 (`data exists without state: use restore`). If the marker exists (an earlier install got past step 11 and then failed), the install **resumes**: the tag must equal the marker's, and step 11 is skipped when `pg/pgdata/PG_VERSION` exists. (2) The tag checks of `upgrade` steps 1 and 2. (3) Creates `build/<tag>` and runs `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile --filter @budmon/budmonctl...` in it. (4) If `secrets/.initialised` is missing: `pnpm --filter @budmon/budmonctl exec tsx src/cli.ts secrets init-local --home "$BUDMON_HOME"` (F-191) in `build/<tag>`, then `apply_secret_ownership`. (5) If `ca/ca.key` is missing: creates the private CA and the Postgres TLS key and certificate for `db.budmon.internal` with `openssl` (RSA 3072, 825 days), writing `TLS_KEY`, `TLS_CERT` and `DB_CA_CERT` through `secret set`. (6) If `site.env` is missing: prompts for each key in F-175's `site.env` table (with the defaults listed there; a blank required answer is written as `__FILL_ME__`) and writes it. (7) **Placeholder check:** lists every secret file whose whole content is `__FILL_ME__` (`sudo grep -rlx`) and every `site.env` key equal to `__FILL_ME__`, by path or key name only; if any, prints them with the next steps (run `gcp-bootstrap.sh`, then `budmon-local secret set …` for each, then re-run `install`) and exits 20. (8) **Permission probe:** for each service directory, `docker run --rm --user <uid> -v <dir>:/s:ro <the server image's base digest> sh -c 'cat /s/* >/dev/null'`; a failure exits 21 naming the directory. (9) Creates the `budmon_capture_db` network (`docker network create --internal --subnet ${CAPTURE_DB_SUBNET}`) and `pg/` (`sudo install -d -o 999 -g 999 -m 0700`), `maintenance/` and `dumps/`. (10) Copies the release (as `upgrade` phase A step 4) and builds the images (phase B step 1). (11) Writes `install.inprogress` (`tag=<tag>`, mode 0600), then starts Postgres once with `BUDMON_FIRST_SETUP=1` and waits up to 60 s for `pg_isready`. (12) Runs `_upgrade-continue <tag> --no-dump --first` (no previous release, so no rollback target; the schema step is idempotent, so a resumed install re-runs it safely); on success, `state` is written and `install.inprogress` removed. (13) Prints `tailscale serve --bg --https=443 http://127.0.0.1:8080` for the owner to run in Windows. | 0; 2; 10; 11; 13; 15; 16; 20; 21 |
  | `upgrade <tag> [--no-dump]` | **Phase A** (the running release's script): (1) The tag must match `^v[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+(-hotfix\.[0-9]+)?$` (exit 10). (2) `git -C "$BUDMON_REPO" fetch --tags origin`. A release tag must be an ancestor of `origin/main`; a hotfix tag `vX.Y.Z-hotfix.N` must be an ancestor of `origin/hotfix/vX.Y.Z-hotfix.N` or of `origin/main` (after its merge-back) (exit 11). (3) `git worktree add --detach build/<tag> <tag>`. (4) Copies `build/<tag>/infra/local/` to `releases/<tag>/` and writes `RELEASE`. If `releases/<tag>/` already exists with a different `commit`, exit 12. (5) `exec releases/<tag>/budmon-local _upgrade-continue <tag> [--no-dump]` with `BUDMON_REEXEC=1`. | 10, 11, 12, or phase B's |
  | `_upgrade-continue <tag> [--no-dump] [--first]` | **Phase B** (the new release's script; internal). (1) Builds into `build/<tag>`: `docker build` of `images/server`, `images/web` (with `BUDMON_BUILD_NUMBER = $(git rev-list --count <tag>)`, as F-185's CLI) and `images/postgres`, tagged `budmon/<image>:<tag>`; then removes the worktree (exit 13 on a build failure). (2) Unless `--no-dump`: `docker compose … exec -T -u postgres postgres pg_dump -Fc -U budmon_admin budmon > dumps/<UTC timestamp>_<state.current>.dump` (mode 0600), then deletes all but the newest 5 files whose names match `^[0-9]{8}T[0-9]{6}Z_v[^_]+\.dump$`; `_pre-restore` dumps are never pruned automatically. (3) If `build/<tag>`'s `apps/server/QUEUE_UPGRADE` marker existed (recorded in step 1): maintenance on, stop both workers. (4) `migrate` with the new release's files (exit 15). (5) `up -d` for both projects with the new release's files and `BUDMON_TAG=<tag>`. (6) Waits up to 120 s for `docker compose exec -T api node dist/main/healthcheck.js --ready` and both workers' health checks. (7) On timeout: unless `--first`, `up -d` both projects with `releases/<state.current>/` and `BUDMON_TAG=<state.current>`, then exit 16 (17 if that fails too); with `--first`, exit 16 and leave the containers for `logs`. (8) Maintenance off if it was turned on; writes `state` (`previous` = old `current`, `current=<tag>`); points `bin/budmon-local` at the new copy; deletes release copies other than the newest 5, never `current` or `previous`; drops any `budmon_old_*` and `budmon_restore_failed_*` databases left by `restore`. (9) Prints the `migrator_previous_password_used` notice when the migrate output has that event (F-92). | 0, 13, 15, 16, 17 |
  | `secret set <host-role>/<service>/<KEY>` | Writes one secret file with the right owner and mode. The path must be one of F-191's table entries, plus `GCP_CREDENTIALS` and the TLS and CA files (exit 64 otherwise). Reads the value from stdin; on a terminal it prompts without echo. An empty value exits 22. Writes with `sudo install -o <uid> -g <uid> -m 0400 /dev/stdin <path>`, so the value never appears in arguments, the environment or a temporary file. Prints `written <host-role>/<service>/<KEY>`, plus `restart needed: budmon-local restart` when the stack is running. | 0, 22, 64 |
  | `start`, `stop`, `restart` | `up -d` / `stop` / both, for both projects at `state.current`. | 0 |
  | `status` | `state`, `docker compose ps`, and `/health/ready` through the API container. | 0 |
  | `logs [service]` | `docker compose logs --tail 200 [-f]`. | 0 |
  | `maintenance on\|off\|status` | Creates or removes `maintenance/on`. | 0 |
  | `restore <dump file>` | Restores a dump **together with the release that wrote it, without touching the current database until the restored copy is proven good.** (1) The file name must match `^[0-9]{8}T[0-9]{6}Z_(v[^_]+)(_pre-restore)?\.dump$`; the captured tag is `T` (exit 12 otherwise). (2) **Validate the file:** `pg_restore --list` on it (run in the Postgres container, file on stdin) must exit 0 and list at least one ` TABLE public ` and one ` TABLE pgboss ` entry (exit 14 `dump invalid`; nothing else is done). (3) If `releases/T/` or the images `budmon/*:T` are missing, runs phase A steps 2 to 4 and phase B step 1 for `T`. The ancestry check (phase A step 2) is skipped when the repository has a local tag `T` whose commit equals the `commit` in an existing `releases/T/RELEASE`, so a hotfix tag stays restorable after its branch is deleted. (4) Postgres must be ready within 60 s (exit 18 `Postgres not running`; see the runbook for a broken cluster). **Safety dump:** `pg_dump -Fc` of the current `budmon` into `dumps/<UTC timestamp>_<state.current>_pre-restore.dump` (mode 0600; never pruned automatically); exit 19 if it fails. (4b) **Free space:** the free space of the filesystem holding `pg/` (and `dumps/`, if different) must be at least 3 × the dump file's size + `pg_database_size('budmon')`; otherwise exit 23 `not enough disk space: need <n> MB, have <m> MB`, before anything is created. (5) As `budmon_admin` over the socket: `DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS budmon_restore WITH (FORCE)`, `CREATE DATABASE budmon_restore OWNER budmon_migrator`, then `pg_restore --exit-on-error -d budmon_restore` from the file. A single-database dump carries no database-level permissions, so it then re-applies F-14's database-level statements to `budmon_restore` by running the image's cluster-bootstrap SQL (`/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/10-budmon.sql.tpl`, idempotent) with `-v dbname=budmon_restore` and the current `MIGRATOR_VERIFIER`; this includes `REVOKE ALL ON DATABASE budmon_restore FROM PUBLIC`. (6) `T`'s `migrate` (whose F-15 step grants `CONNECT` back to the login roles) and then `T`'s `cli restore:verify`, both run as the **`migrate` service** with its secrets (`budmon_migrator`, which holds `pg_read_all_data` and `EXECUTE` on `bt_index_check`) and `DB_NAME=budmon_restore`, never as `budmon_app` (exit 15 or 6). The live database and the running stack are untouched up to here. (7) **Switch:** maintenance on; stops the workers and the API; `ALTER DATABASE budmon WITH ALLOW_CONNECTIONS false`; `pg_terminate_backend` for every remaining connection to `budmon` and `budmon_restore`; `ALTER DATABASE budmon RENAME TO budmon_old_<UTC timestamp>`; `ALTER DATABASE budmon_restore RENAME TO budmon`. If a rename fails because a session is still connected, the terminate-and-rename is retried up to 3 times, 2 s apart (exit 24 after that, with the names restored and `ALLOW_CONNECTIONS` back on). `ALLOW_CONNECTIONS true` is set on the new `budmon` after the renames (`budmon_old_<ts>` stays closed). (8) `up -d` both projects with `releases/T/`, then the readiness wait of phase B step 6. (9) On success: writes `state` (`previous` = old `current`, `current=T`), points `bin/budmon-local` at `T`'s copy, maintenance off, prints the kept `budmon_old_<ts>` name, exit 0. On a readiness timeout: stops `T`'s stack, renames `budmon` → `budmon_restore_failed_<ts>` and `budmon_old_<ts>` → `budmon` (with the same connection-block, terminate and retry rule), sets `ALLOW_CONNECTIONS true` on `budmon`, starts `state.current`'s release, leaves maintenance on, exit 16. (10) **On every failure** after step 4, the current `budmon` is left in place (or put back) and maintenance stays on only if step 7 had started, and the safety dump's path is printed. `budmon_old_*` and `budmon_restore_failed_*` databases are listed by `status` and dropped by the next successful `upgrade` (phase B step 8). | 0; 6; 12; 14; 15; 16; 18; 19; 23; 24 |
  | `bootstrap-owner --email <address> [--replace]` (A-6) | Refuses with exit 25 (`stack not running`) unless `api` of the current release is running. Runs `docker compose … exec -T api node dist/main/cli.js identity:bootstrap-owner --email <address> [--replace]` and passes its stdout, stderr and exit code through unchanged. Never `compose run` (its output would reach the json-file logs). | the command's 0, 1 or 64; 25; 64 if `--email` is missing |
  | anything else | Usage text. | 64 |
- **Errors:** every exit above prints a one-line reason. The script never prints secret values; `secret set` and the placeholder check name paths and keys only.

#### F-179: Google Cloud bootstrap script (stage 0)
- **File:** `infra/local/gcp-bootstrap.sh` (bash, idempotent, uses `gcloud`; run once by the owner in WSL2)
- **Preconditions:** `${BUDMON_HOME}/secrets/.initialised` and `${BUDMON_HOME}/site.env` exist (that is, `budmon-local install` has run up to its placeholder check); otherwise it prints `run budmon-local install <tag> first` and exits 2.
- **Behaviour:** in the owner's project (`--project` argument, region `europe-west3`) it creates, if missing:
  - the key ring `budmon` and the key `capture-credentials` (`ASYMMETRIC_DECRYPT`, `RSA_DECRYPT_OAEP_3072_SHA256`);
  - the service account `budmon-capture` with `roles/cloudkms.cryptoKeyDecrypter` on that key only;
  - the Pub/Sub topic `gmail-push` (publisher `gmail-api-push@system.gserviceaccount.com`) and the pull subscription `gmail-push-capture` (7-day retention) with `roles/pubsub.subscriber` for `budmon-capture`;
  - Data Access audit logging for Cloud KMS.

  It then:
  - writes the primary key version's public key through `budmon-local secret set` into `main/api/CAPTURE_PUBLIC_KEY`, `main/worker-general/CAPTURE_PUBLIC_KEY` and `capture/worker-capture/CAPTURE_PUBLIC_KEY`;
  - sets `CAPTURE_KEY_VERSION=projects/<p>/locations/europe-west3/keyRings/budmon/cryptoKeys/capture-credentials/cryptoKeyVersions/<n>` in `site.env`;
  - prints, without running it, `gcloud iam service-accounts keys create /dev/stdout --iam-account=budmon-capture@<p>.iam.gserviceaccount.com | budmon-local secret set capture/worker-capture/GCP_CREDENTIALS`, so the key goes straight into its file.

  The stage-1 LLD moves these resources under OpenTofu (import, no re-creation), so the KMS key and its envelopes survive the move.

### 4.16 `budmonctl` owner-side commands (S-15)

#### F-190: `scramVerifier`
- **File:** `infra/budmonctl/src/scram.ts`
- **Signature:** `export function scramVerifier(password: string, opts?: { salt?: Buffer; iterations?: number }): string`
- **Behaviour:** RFC 5802/7677. `SaltedPassword = PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA-256(password, salt, iterations, 32)`; `ClientKey = HMAC(SaltedPassword, "Client Key")`; `StoredKey = SHA-256(ClientKey)`; `ServerKey = HMAC(SaltedPassword, "Server Key")`. Returns `SCRAM-SHA-256$<iterations>:<b64 salt>$<b64 StoredKey>:<b64 ServerKey>`. Defaults: 4096 iterations, 16 random salt bytes.

#### F-191: `initLocalSecrets` (`budmonctl secrets init-local --home <dir>`)
- **File:** `infra/budmonctl/src/localSecrets.ts`
- **Signature:** `export async function initLocalSecrets(input: { budmonHome: string }, deps: { randomBytes: (n: number) => Buffer /* [inj] */; mkdir: (path: string, mode: number) => Promise<void> /* [inj] */; writeFile: (path: string, data: string, mode: number) => Promise<void> /* [inj] */; exists: (path: string) => Promise<boolean> /* [inj] */ }): Promise<{ files: string[] }>`
- **Behaviour:** refuses if `${budmonHome}/secrets` exists. Creates the directories (mode 0700) and one file per key (mode 0600), owned by the calling WSL user, under `${budmonHome}/secrets/<host-role>/<service>/`, and writes the marker `secrets/.initialised` last. F-178 then hands each service directory to its container's UID with the final modes (F-178's layout table), and from then on files are written only through `budmon-local secret set`. Run by F-178 `install` step 4 from the tag's worktree.

  | Directory | Generated files | Placeholders (`__FILL_ME__`) the owner fills in |
  | --------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
  | `main/api` | `DB_PASSWORD`, `CURSOR_KEY`, `RATE_LIMIT_HMAC_KEY`, `API_SECRETS_KEYS` (`{"current":"k1","keys":{"k1":…}}`), `RECOVERY_CODE_HMAC_KEYS` (same shape; A-3) | `S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` (B2 read-only key), `CAPTURE_PUBLIC_KEY` (F-179), `GOOGLE_SIGNIN_CLIENT_SECRET` (A-3) |
  | `main/worker-general` | `DB_PASSWORD` (the same value as `api`'s; both are `budmon_app`), `QUEUE_DB_PASSWORD`; `SMTP_PASSWORD` written **empty** (Mailpit needs none; set with `secret set` when using a relay; A-2) | `S3_*` (B2 write keys), `FX_PRIMARY_APP_ID`, `CAPTURE_PUBLIC_KEY` |
  | `main/migrate` | `DB_PASSWORD` (migrator), `ROLE_SECRETS` (JSON of SCRAM verifiers from F-190 for `budmon_app`, `budmon_capture`, `budmon_queue`, `budmon_monitor` and `budmon_migrator`; `budmon_monitor` gets a random password that nothing uses until stage 1) | none |
  | `main/postgres` | `ADMIN_PASSWORD`, `MIGRATOR_VERIFIER` (`TLS_KEY`/`TLS_CERT` are added by F-178 `install` step 5) | none |
  | `capture/worker-capture` | `DB_PASSWORD` (`budmon_capture`), `MAILBOX_HMAC_KEY` (`DB_CA_CERT` is added by F-178 `install` step 5) | `GCP_CREDENTIALS`, `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`, `CAPTURE_PUBLIC_KEY` |

  Passwords are 32 random bytes, base64url. Keys are 32 bytes, base64. Nothing is printed except the file list.
- **Rule:** the API, workers and `migrate` refuse to start while any configured file or variable is exactly `__FILL_ME__` (F-11 reports `<VARIABLE>: placeholder not filled`). Postgres's files have no placeholders. F-178's placeholder check catches them before any container starts.
- **Errors:** an existing directory → exit 2.
- Rotating role passwords and SOPS-based secret sets (v0.5's `rotate-role`, `init-deployment`, `clear-previous`) are stage-1 commands, specified in the stage-1 LLD. F-92's previous-password fallback stays in the server image from day one.

### 4.17 Release tooling (S-14) and the rehearsal (S-16)

#### F-180: `generateReleaseMigration` (`pnpm db:release-migration <version>`)
- **File:** `apps/server/tools/releaseMigration.ts`
- **Signature:** `export async function generateReleaseMigration(input: { version: string; serverDir: string; timeoutMs?: number }, deps: { spawnPty: typeof import("node-pty").spawn /* [inj] */ }): Promise<{ file: string | null; ambiguities: string[] }>`
- **Behaviour:**
  1. `version` must match `^v\d+\.\d+\.\d+(-hotfix\.\d+)?$`.
  2. Spawns `pnpm exec drizzle-kit generate --name <version>` in `serverDir` under a pty (80×24).
  3. Whenever the output (ANSI stripped) contains a line matching `/created or renamed|renamed from another|create (table|column|enum|sequence|view)/i` followed by a selection list, writes `"\r"`, which selects the first option ("+ create …"), and records the question line in `ambiguities`.
  4. On exit 0, returns the newly created `drizzle/NNNN_<version>.sql`, or `null` if the output contains "No schema changes".
- **Errors:** a non-zero exit → `Error("drizzle-kit generate failed")` with the exit code. A timeout (default 120 s) kills the process and throws `Error("generate timed out")`.

#### F-181: `pendingSchemaReport` (`pnpm db:pending-report`)
- **File:** `apps/server/tools/releaseMigration.ts`
- **Signature:** `export async function pendingSchemaReport(input: { serverDir: string }, deps: …): Promise<{ sql: string; ambiguities: string[] }>`
- **Behaviour:** copies `serverDir/drizzle` and `drizzle.config.ts` into a temp directory, runs F-180's logic there with `--name pending`, and returns the generated SQL (or `""`). It never writes into the repository. CI posts the result as a pull-request comment (non-blocking).

#### F-182: `checkMigrationsReproduceSchema` (`pnpm db:check-migrations`, check (i))
- **File:** `apps/server/tools/checkMigrations.ts`
- **Signature:** `export async function checkMigrationsReproduceSchema(input: { serverDir: string }, deps: { startPostgres: () => Promise<{ superuserUrl: string; stop(): Promise<void> }> /* [inj] */ }): Promise<{ ok: boolean; snapshotClean: boolean; dumpDiff: string }>`
- **Behaviour:**
  - (a) `snapshotClean`: F-181 returns `sql === ""`.
  - (b) On one Postgres instance, builds two databases: `push_ref` (F-14, then F-19 push mode) and `from_migrations` (F-14, then F-19 migrate mode). Runs `pg_dump --schema-only --no-owner --no-privileges --schema=public` on each, normalises (drops comments, blank lines and `SET`/`SELECT pg_catalog.set_config` lines, sorts statements), and diffs.
  - `ok = snapshotClean && dumpDiff === ""`.
  - With no migrations at all (before the first release), returns `{ ok: true, snapshotClean: true, dumpDiff: "" }` and CI skips it on non-release branches.

#### F-183: upgrade test harness
- **File:** `apps/server/test/upgrade/` (test-architect)
- **Rule:** for release `vN`, builds the previous release's database from the migrations at the previous release tag (`git show <prevTag>:apps/server/drizzle/…` into a temp folder), loads `apps/server/test/upgrade/<vN>/fixtures.sql`, applies the current migrations, then runs `apps/server/test/upgrade/<vN>/*.test.ts`. If there's no previous release tag, the harness reports "skipped: baseline" and passes.

#### F-184: `checkRiskyStatements` (`pnpm db:check-risky <files…>`)
- **File:** `apps/server/tools/checkRisky.ts`
- **Signature:** `export function checkRiskyStatements(sql: string): { line: number; pattern: string }[]`
- **Behaviour:**
  - Splits on Drizzle's `--> statement-breakpoint`.
  - Flags statements matching (case-insensitive):
    - `DROP TABLE`, `DROP COLUMN`, `RENAME`, `ALTER COLUMN … TYPE`, `SET NOT NULL`;
    - `ADD COLUMN … NOT NULL` without `DEFAULT`;
    - `ADD CONSTRAINT …` (`CHECK` or `FOREIGN KEY`) without `NOT VALID`;
    - `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX`, `DROP INDEX`, `TRUNCATE`, `DELETE FROM`.
  - A statement preceded by a line `-- reviewed: <at least 10 characters>` isn't flagged.
  - The CLI prints `file:line pattern` and exits 1 if anything is flagged.

#### F-185: `buildNumber`
- **File:** `tools/ci/buildNumber.ts` (also used by F-178 through `pnpm --filter @budmon/tools-ci exec tsx buildNumber.ts <tag>`; sources at the package root, A-7)
- **Signature:** `export function buildNumber(revCount: number): number`, plus the CLI, which runs `git rev-list --count <tag>` and prints the result.
- **Behaviour:** returns `revCount` (the number of commits reachable from the tag). It's monotonic along `main`, and a hotfix branched from the last release tag has a count greater than that tag's. This number is the web build number (`X-Budmon-Client: web/<n>`, `version.json`).
  - In stage 1 the stage-1 LLD may replace it with the release workflow's sequence number (HLD D-29 rule 4); `CLIENT_MIN_WEB` is then raised to the first stage-1 number.
- **Errors:** a non-positive integer → `RangeError`.

#### Stage-0 tagging: `tools/ci/tagRelease.sh` and `tag.yml`
- **Triggers:** `pull_request: [closed]` on `main` (release mode, only when `merged` is true and the head branch starts with `release/`), and `workflow_dispatch` with input `pr` (hotfix mode). `permissions: contents: write, pull-requests: read, checks: read`; `actions/checkout` with `fetch-depth: 0`. No signing or deploy job.
- **Naming (one rule, HLD D-12):**

  | | Release | Hotfix |
  | - | ------- | ------ |
  | Branch | `release/vX.Y.Z` from `main` | `hotfix/vX.Y.Z-hotfix.N` from the last tag of any kind (`vX.Y.Z` for N = 1, else `vX.Y.Z-hotfix.(N-1)`) |
  | Pull request base | `main` | `main`, kept open until after the tag is installed; the same PR is then merged as the merge-back (label `hotfix-merge-back`) **with "Create a merge commit"** (never squash or rebase), so the tagged commit becomes an ancestor of `main`. The repository keeps merge commits allowed (runbook). If `main` requires up-to-date branches, "Update branch" after tagging is fine: the tag stays on the commit that was checked |
  | Tag | `vX.Y.Z` (the branch suffix) | `vX.Y.Z-hotfix.N` (the branch suffix) |
  | Tagged commit | the merge commit | the PR's head commit |
  | `budmon-local` ancestry check (F-178) | ancestor of `origin/main` | ancestor of `origin/hotfix/vX.Y.Z-hotfix.N`, or of `origin/main` after the merge-back |

- **`tagRelease.sh <mode> <pr>` behaviour:** reads the PR with `gh pr view`.
  - Release mode: the head branch must match `^release/(v[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+)$` (exit 1 `branch name invalid`); the PR must be merged (otherwise exit 0, nothing done); commit = the merge commit.
  - Hotfix mode: the head branch must match `^hotfix/(v[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+)-hotfix\.([0-9]+)$` (exit 1 `branch name invalid`); the PR must be open (exit 1 `pull request not open`) with base `main` (exit 1 `base must be main`) and every required check green on the head (exit 1 `checks not green`); the head must contain tag `vX.Y.Z` and, for N > 1, `vX.Y.Z-hotfix.(N-1)` (`git merge-base --is-ancestor`; exit 1 `not built on <tag>`); commit = the head.
  - Both: the tag must not exist (exit 1 `tag exists`); `pnpm db:check-migrations` (F-182, check (i)) on a checkout of the commit must pass (exit 1); then `git tag <tag> <commit>` and `git push origin <tag>`.

#### F-195: `runRehearsal` (stage-0 shape)
- **File:** `tools/rehearsal/src/run.ts`; CLI `pnpm --filter @budmon/tools-rehearsal rehearse --previous <tag|none>`
- **Signature:** `export async function runRehearsal(opts: { previousTag: string | null; images: { server: string; web: string; postgres: string }; workDir: string }, deps: { exec: (cmd: string, args: string[], o?: object) => Promise<{ code: number; stdout: string }> /* [inj] */; http?: (req: { method: "GET" | "POST"; path: string; headers: Record<string, string>; body?: string }) => Promise<{ status: number; headers: Record<string, string | string[]>; body: string }> /* [inj], A-33; default: node:http to 127.0.0.1:8080 */ }): Promise<{ ok: boolean; steps: { name: string; ok: boolean; detail: string }[] }>`
- **Steps** (each recorded; the first failure stops the run, except that cleanup and artifact collection always run). The topology is the **laptop's** (`infra/local/compose.main.yaml` + `compose.capture.yaml`) with the overlay `infra/local/rehearsal/compose.rehearsal.yaml`.
  1. `secrets`: F-191 into a temp `BUDMON_HOME`; placeholders filled with throwaway values through `budmon-local secret set`; the CA and TLS files as in F-178 `install` step 5; `apply_secret_ownership` (the runner has passwordless `sudo`), so the containers read their files under the same UIDs and modes as on the laptop; a `site.env` with throwaway values, including Google sign-in (A-24): `GOOGLE_SIGNIN_CLIENT_ID=rehearsal-signin.apps.googleusercontent.com` (`REHEARSAL_SIGNIN_CLIENT_ID`, F-193's file), `GOOGLE_SIGNIN_CALLBACK_ORIGIN=http://localhost:8080`, `GOOGLE_SIGNIN_APP_ORIGINS=http://localhost:8080` (A-3's rule admits `http://localhost:<port>`, not `127.0.0.1`) and an empty `GOOGLE_SIGNIN_ANDROID_CLIENT_IDS`; the `GOOGLE_SIGNIN_CLIENT_SECRET` placeholder is filled like the others. The candidate's `infra/local/` is copied into `releases/<candidate>/` as F-178 does, and every Compose call uses that copy.
  2. `previous-db`:
     - `previousTag` not null: start Postgres from the **postgres image** with `BUDMON_FIRST_SETUP=1`, run the previous release's `migrate` image, then load `apps/server/test/upgrade/<version>/fixtures.sql`;
     - `previousTag = null`: first setup only.
  3. `migrate`: run the new `migrate` image.
  4. `stack-up`: both projects with the overlay. The overlay provides:
     - `APP_ENV=rehearsal` with `KMS_PROVIDER=local`;
     - MinIO for B2;
     - F-197 behind `FX_PRIMARY_BASE_URL`/`FX_FALLBACK_BASE_URL`;
     - the base stack's own Mailpit (A-2; the overlay adds nothing for email), whose API the harness reads at its published address `http://127.0.0.1:8025/api/v1/` (the harness runs on the runner host, outside `mail-ui`; A-25);
     - F-196, started by the harness with `signInClientId = REHEARSAL_SIGNIN_CLIENT_ID` and a fresh `generateSignInKeyPair()` (A-24), reachable as the Google hostnames (`oauth2.googleapis.com`, `www.googleapis.com`, `gmail.googleapis.com`, `pubsub.googleapis.com`) through `extra_hosts`, with `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` set to its CA, on the capture-path containers and on **`api`** (A-24; `api` reaches it over `egress`, A-3). The harness's CA issues the fake's leaf certificate with exactly those four names as SANs;
     - `SENTRY_DSN` pointing at F-194.
  5. `ready`: `/health/ready` is 200 through Caddy on `127.0.0.1:8080`, and both workers are healthy within 120 s.
  6. `upgrade-assertions` (`previousTag` not null): runs `apps/server/test/upgrade/<version>/*.test.ts` against the migrated database.
  7. `canary-flows`: runs `tools/rehearsal/checks/canaryFlows.test.ts` (test-architect) through Caddy. Then three sub-steps, in this order, each recorded as `canary-flows/<name>` (A-2, A-6, A-24, A-25). The harness keeps a list `needles: Needle[]` (F-193) that step 8 scans for. **HTTP in the sub-steps:** `deps.http` (A-33; by default `node:http` to `127.0.0.1:8080`) with `Host: localhost:8080` (Caddy; the origin A-24 configures), `Origin: http://localhost:8080` on every `POST`, and JSON bodies. 7a and 7b send no `X-Budmon-Client` header (kind `other`, never blocked; they use body delivery); 7c sends one on every request (A-33). Request and response shapes are identity's (identity LLD §5); an unexpected answer fails the sub-step with a detail naming the request, the status and the error key only. **Skipping:** a sub-step is recorded `skipped: identity not built` when the one before it was skipped, or when its first request answers `404` with envelope code `NOT_FOUND` (7a: when the CLI prints `Unknown command:`); a skipped sub-step doesn't fail the run.
     - **7a `bootstrap-owner`** (A-6, A-25): `docker compose exec -T api node dist/main/cli.js identity:bootstrap-owner --email rehearsal-owner.7f3a@example.invalid` (`REHEARSAL_OWNER_EMAIL`, F-193's file; deliberately **not** `canaries.email`, which 7b invites and 7c expects to have no account). Takes the token from the printed link's `#t=` fragment. Needles: `bootstrap-token`, `owner-email`. Any other non-zero exit fails. Upgrade fixtures (`apps/server/test/upgrade/<version>/fixtures.sql`) never contain an owner user, so this runs on upgraded databases too.
     - **7b `email-canary`** (A-25, identity PA-10):
       1. `POST /api/v1/invitations/accept` with `{ token: <bootstrap token>, displayName: "Rehearsal Owner", locale: "en", timeZone: "UTC", baseCurrency: "USD", method: { kind: "password", password: <ownerPassword> }, tokenDelivery: "body" }` plus any device fields identity's contract requires. `ownerPassword` is base64url of 24 random bytes (needle `owner-password`). Expects 2xx. Every string value in the response JSON matching `^bm[a-z]_[A-Za-z0-9_-]{43}$` becomes a needle (`session-token-<i>`); the `bma_` one is the owner's access token.
       2. `POST /api/v1/invitations` with `Authorization: Bearer <access token>`, `Idempotency-Key: <random UUID>` and `{ email: canaries.email }`. Expects 201.
       3. `POST /api/v1/auth/password-reset/request` with `{ email: REHEARSAL_OWNER_EMAIL }`. Expects 2xx.
       4. Polls `GET http://127.0.0.1:8025/api/v1/messages` every 2 s for up to 60 s, until there's a message whose `To` holds `canaries.email` and one whose `To` holds `REHEARSAL_OWNER_EMAIL`. For each, `GET http://127.0.0.1:8025/api/v1/message/<ID>` and extracts every match of `#t=(bm[a-z]_[A-Za-z0-9_-]{43})` from `Text` and `HTML`. Passes when the invitation message yields at least one `bmi_` token and the reset message at least one `bmp_` token; every extracted token becomes a needle (`mail-token-<i>`). Timeout → fails with detail `mail_not_delivered`. `canaries.email` needs no needle: it's a CANARIES member.
     - **7c `google-sign-in`** (A-24, identity PA-9; header A-33, identity PA-12): first reads `GET /version.json` → `buildNumber` = `n` and `GET /api/v1/meta/client-config` → `web.minimumBuild`; `n < minimumBuild` fails with `web_build_below_minimum`. Every request below sends `X-Budmon-Client: web/<n>`, so the client kind is `web` and identity's login-CSRF guard admits cookie delivery.
       1. `POST /api/v1/auth/google/start` with `{ intent: "sign_in", returnTo: "/" }`. Expects 200 `{ authorizationUrl }`; keeps every `Set-Cookie` name and value as the cookie jar (the binding cookie).
       2. Reads the `state` and `nonce` query parameters from `authorizationUrl` (both required). Needles: `google-state`, `google-nonce`.
       3. `GET /api/v1/auth/google/callback?code=<fakeSignInCode(nonce)>&state=<state>` with **no cookies** (as a browser arriving from Google with `SameSite=Strict` cookies). Expects `303` with a `Location` ending in `#h=(bmh_[A-Za-z0-9_-]{43})`. Needles: `google-code`, `google-handoff`.
       4. `POST /api/v1/auth/google/complete` with `{ handoff, tokenDelivery: "cookie" }` and the jar's cookies. Expects `404` with envelope code `GOOGLE_ACCOUNT_UNKNOWN` and `data.email` equal to `canaries.email` (the canary address has only a pending invitation, no user).
  8. `scan`: F-198 `scanForCanaries(sources, CANARIES)` and F-193 `scanForNeedles(sources, needles)` (A-24) over every container's `docker logs`, Caddy's access and error logs, the Postgres log, the captured Sentry events, and `SELECT output FROM pgboss.job`. Any hit fails the step; the detail lists the source and the canary or needle **name**, never a value.
  8b. `mailpit-quiet` (A-2): `docker inspect` of `mailpit` shows `HostConfig.LogConfig.Type = none` and `--quiet` in its command, and its only published port is `127.0.0.1:8025`.
  9. `no-stage-setting`: `docker inspect` every application container. Fail if `Config.Env` or `Mounts` mention `HOST_ROLE`, `DEPLOYMENT`, `INFRA_STAGE` or `STAGE`.
  10. `cross-role-secrets`: no `budmon-main` container mounts anything under `secrets/capture`, and vice versa; worker-capture can't open a TCP connection to `PG_DATA_IP:5432` (it isn't on `data`).
  11. `gate-commands`:
      - `cli secrets:rewrap-api` exits 0;
      - `pg_dump -Fc` the migrated database, restore it into a fresh Postgres container with `budmon-local restore` logic (F-178), then `cli restore:verify` exits 0 and `cli erasure:replay --since <run start>` exits 0;
      - F-92's previous-password fallback: change `budmon_migrator`'s `DB_PASSWORD` in the temp secrets, keep the old value as `DB_PASSWORD_PREVIOUS` and the new verifier in `ROLE_SECRETS`; `migrate` succeeds through the fallback, and a second run logs in without it.
  12. `maintenance`: touch the flag. `/api/v1/meta/client-config` → 503 envelope; `/health/ready` → 503 `maintenance`. Remove it → 200.
  13. `rollback` (`previousTag` not null): start the previous release's images on the migrated database and expect `/health/ready` 200.
  14. `smoke`: `apps/web/e2e/smoke.spec.ts` (test-architect) against `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.

  Artifacts (logs, scan report, Sentry events) are uploaded by the workflow.
- The server-topology steps (deploy bundles, signatures, the egress proxy, Alloy, pgBackRest, infrastructure-only releases) are added by the stage-1 LLD (HLD D-41).

#### F-196: fake Google
- **File:** `tools/rehearsal/src/fakeGoogle.ts`
- **Signatures:**
  ```ts
  export const FAKE_SIGNIN_KID = "fake-signin-1";                                                    // A-24
  export function generateSignInKeyPair(): { privateKey: KeyObject; publicKey: KeyObject };           // A-24: node:crypto RSA-2048, one per run
  export function fakeSignInCode(nonce: string): string;                                              // A-24: "signin." + base64url(UTF-8 nonce)
  export function startFakeGoogle(opts: { tls: { key: Buffer; cert: Buffer }; port: number; controlPort: number; canaries: Canaries;
    signInClientId: string; signInKeyPair: { privateKey: KeyObject; publicKey: KeyObject } }): Promise<{ close(): Promise<void> }>;
  ```
- **Behaviour:** HTTPS server answering by the `Host` header:
  - `oauth2.googleapis.com POST /token` (form-encoded), by the form's `client_id` (A-24):
    - **`client_id` equals `signInClientId` (sign-in):** the `code` must match `^signin\.([A-Za-z0-9_-]{1,512})$` and its group must decode (base64url, then UTF-8) to a non-empty string, the nonce. Otherwise `400 {"error":"invalid_grant"}`. On success, `200 { access_token: canaries.token, id_token: <JWT>, expires_in: 3599, token_type: "Bearer", scope: "openid email profile" }`. The JWT's header is `{ alg: "RS256", kid: FAKE_SIGNIN_KID, typ: "JWT" }`; it's signed with `crypto.sign("sha256", <header>.<payload>, privateKey)` (RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5); its claims are exactly `iss "https://accounts.google.com"`, `aud` and `azp` = `signInClientId`, `sub "canary-sub-7f3a"`, `email` = `canaries.email`, `email_verified true`, `name "Canary User"`, `iat` = now (epoch seconds), `exp` = `iat + 3600`, `nonce` = the decoded nonce. The control mode doesn't apply to this branch.
    - **Any other `client_id`, or none (Gmail):** `{ access_token: canaries.token, refresh_token: canaries.token + "-r", expires_in: 3599, scope: "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly", token_type: "Bearer" }`, subject to the control mode.
  - `www.googleapis.com GET /oauth2/v3/certs` (A-24) → `200`, `Content-Type: application/json`, `{ keys: [{ kty: "RSA", n, e, kid: FAKE_SIGNIN_KID, alg: "RS256", use: "sig" }] }` from `publicKey.export({ format: "jwk" })`: public members only.
  - `gmail.googleapis.com GET /gmail/v1/users/me/history` and `/messages/:id` → canary content (`snippet` and `payload.body.data` hold `canaries.message`; headers hold `canaries.payee`);
  - `pubsub.googleapis.com` → `503` (sources' tests use their own fakes).
  - Any other host or path → `404`.

  `POST /__control { mode: "ok" | "invalid_grant" | "server_error" | "gaxios_error" }` on `controlPort` switches the Gmail token branch: `400 {error:"invalid_grant", error_description: canaries.message}`, `500` with a body containing `canaries.token`, or a malformed body that triggers a client exception with config.

#### F-197: fake FX
- **File:** `tools/rehearsal/src/fakeFx.ts`
- **Behaviour:** serves `/historical/<date>.json` (OXR shape) and `/<date>/currencies/usd.json` (fawazahmed0 shape) with F-133's fixed rates.

#### F-198: `CANARIES` and `scanForCanaries` (delivered in S-3)
- **File:** `packages/test-support/src/canaries.ts` (`@budmon/test-support`, test tooling owned by the test-architect; the rehearsal harness imports it read-only)
- **Signatures:** `export interface Canaries { amountMinor: string; payee: string; email: string; token: string; message: string }; export const CANARIES: Canaries; export function scanForCanaries(sources: readonly { name: string; text: string }[], canaries: Canaries): { source: string; canary: keyof Canaries; offset: number }[]`
- **Canaries:** `amountMinor: "987654321"`, `payee: "CANARYPAYEE7f3a"`, `email: "canary.7f3a@example.invalid"`, `token: "ya29.CANARYTOKEN7f3a"`, `message: "CANARYMESSAGE7f3a"`.
- **Behaviour:** case-sensitive substring search. Also searches the URL-encoded form and the base64 forms of each canary: for each alignment `k` ∈ {0, 1, 2}, the stable core of `base64(k filler bytes + canary)`, in the standard and URL-safe alphabets, so a canary is found at any byte offset of an encoded payload (A-117).

#### F-193: `scanForNeedles` and the rehearsal constants (A-24, A-25)
- **File:** `tools/rehearsal/src/needles.ts` (platform code in the harness; F-198 stays the test-architect's)
- **Signatures:**
  ```ts
  export const REHEARSAL_OWNER_EMAIL = "rehearsal-owner.7f3a@example.invalid";
  export const REHEARSAL_SIGNIN_CLIENT_ID = "rehearsal-signin.apps.googleusercontent.com";
  export interface Needle { name: string; value: string }
  export function scanForNeedles(sources: readonly { name: string; text: string }[], needles: readonly Needle[]): { source: string; needle: string; offset: number }[];
  ```
- **Behaviour:** values the rehearsal learns at run time (tokens, the owner's address and password). For each needle, the same three forms F-198 searches: the raw value, its base64 form and its `encodeURIComponent` form, case-sensitive. Returns one hit per occurrence, ordered by source then offset. A hit carries the needle's **name**, never its value.
- **Errors:** a needle whose `value` is shorter than 8 characters throws `TypeError` (naming the needle), so a short value can't match by accident.

#### F-194: `startSentryCapture`
- **File:** `tools/rehearsal/src/sentryCapture.ts` (S-16)
- **Signature:** `export function startSentryCapture(port: number): Promise<{ events(): string[]; close(): Promise<void> }>`
- **Behaviour:** an HTTP server accepting Sentry envelope `POST`s on `/api/<project>/envelope/`, storing each raw body for F-198's scan, and answering 200.

### 4.18 Web (S-11a, S-11b, S-12)

All files are under `apps/web/src/`. §8.1 gives routes and screen behaviour.

#### F-200: application entry (`main.tsx`)
- **Behaviour:**
  1. `initWebSentry` (F-217).
  2. Creates the query client (F-204) and API client (F-201).
  3. Loads the locale (F-206): user preference later from `identity`; for now `navigator.language` resolved against the supported locales.
  4. Renders `<I18nProvider><QueryClientProvider><RouterProvider/><Toaster/><UpdateNotifier/><OfflineBanner/></…>` into `#root`.

#### F-201: `createApiClient`
- **File:** `api/client.ts`
- **Signature:** `export function createApiClient(opts: { buildNumber: number; baseUrl?: string; fetch?: typeof fetch; onClientUpdateRequired?: () => void }): ContractRouterClient<typeof contract>`
- **Behaviour:** `new OpenAPILink(contract, { url: baseUrl ?? location.origin + "/api/v1", headers: () => ({ "X-Budmon-Client": "web/" + buildNumber, traceparent: newTraceparent() }), fetch: (req, init) => (opts.fetch ?? fetch)(req, { ...init, credentials: "same-origin" }) })`. Any response error with code `CLIENT_UPDATE_REQUIRED` calls `onClientUpdateRequired`. `newTraceparent()` returns `00-<32 hex>-<16 hex>-01` from `crypto.getRandomValues`.

#### F-202: `toAppError`
- **File:** `api/errors.ts`
- **Signature:** `export type AppError = { kind: "defined"; key: string; status: number; data: unknown } | { kind: "unavailable" } | { kind: "network" } | { kind: "timeout" } | { kind: "unknown" }; export function toAppError(err: unknown): AppError`
- **Behaviour:**
  - An oRPC client error with `defined: true` → `defined`.
  - A non-envelope response with status 502, 503 or 504 (Caddy answering while the API is down or restarting) → `unavailable`.
  - A `TypeError` from fetch, or `navigator.onLine === false` → `network`.
  - An `AbortError` caused by a timeout → `timeout`.
  - Otherwise → `unknown`.

#### F-203: `messageForError`
- **File:** `api/errorMessages.ts`
- **Signature:** `export function messageForError(e: AppError, operation: "read" | "create" | "mutation"): { descriptor: MessageDescriptor; values?: Record<string, string | number> }`
- **Behaviour** (the HLD §4.9 table):

  | `AppError` | Message ID |
  | ---------- | ---------- |
  | `INTERNAL` with outcome `not_applied` and a non-read operation | `error.generic.notChanged` |
  | `INTERNAL` with outcome `unknown`, or `timeout` on a non-read | `error.generic.unknownOutcome` |
  | `INTERNAL` on a read | `error.generic.read` |
  | `VALIDATION_FAILED` | `error.validation.form` |
  | `RATE_LIMITED` | `error.rateLimited` with `{ minutes: ceil(retryAfterSeconds / 60) }` |
  | `SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE` with outcome `unknown` on a non-read | `error.generic.unknownOutcome` |
  | `SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE` (otherwise), `unavailable` or `network` | `error.unavailable` |
  | `NOT_FOUND` | `error.notFound` |
  | `FORBIDDEN` | `error.forbidden` |
  | `CLIENT_UPDATE_REQUIRED` | `update.required.web` |
  | Unknown keys and `unknown` | The generic message for the operation (`read` → `error.generic.read`, otherwise `error.generic.unknownOutcome`) |

#### F-204: `createQueryClient`
- **File:** `api/queryClient.ts`
- **Signature:** `export function createQueryClient(): QueryClient`
- **Behaviour:**
  - **Queries:** `retry(failureCount, err)` is true while `failureCount < 3` and `toAppError(err)` is `network`, `timeout`, or `defined` with status ≥ 500. `retryDelay: (n) => 1000 × 2^n`. `refetchOnWindowFocus: true`. `staleTime: 30000`.
  - **Mutations:** `retry` is the same rule only when `mutation.meta?.idempotent === true`, otherwise 0.

#### F-205: `createCreateMutation`
- **File:** `api/createMutation.ts`
- **Signature:** `export function createCreateMutation<I>(opts: { mutationFn: (input: I, idempotencyKey: string) => Promise<{ id: string; createdAt: string }>; invalidate: readonly QueryKey[] }): CreateMutationResult<{ id: string; createdAt: string }, unknown, I>`
- **Behaviour:**
  - The helper keeps a current key (`crypto.randomUUID()`) and the `canonicalJson` of the last failed input.
  - A `mutate(input)` reuses the current key if the previous call **failed** with the same canonical input, otherwise it generates a new key. So automatic retries and a manual **Try again** with unchanged input reuse the key, and the server deduplicates.
  - After a success, or when the input changes, the next call gets a new key.
  - It sets `meta: { idempotent: true }`. On success it invalidates every key in `invalidate`.

#### F-206: i18n provider
- **File:** `i18n/I18nProvider.tsx`, `i18n/useI18n.ts`
- **Signature:** `export function I18nProvider(props: { initialLocale: string; children: JSX.Element }): JSX.Element; export function useI18n(): { locale: Accessor<string>; dir: Accessor<"ltr" | "rtl">; t: (d: MessageDescriptor, v?: Record<string, unknown>) => string; formatMoney: (m: Money, minorUnits: number) => string; formatDate: (d: Temporal.PlainDate) => string; formatInstant: (i: Temporal.Instant, timeZone: string) => string; formatRelative: (i: Temporal.Instant, now: Temporal.Instant) => string; setLocale: (l: string) => Promise<void> }`
- **Behaviour:**
  - Supported locales: `en`, plus `en-XA` and `ar-XB` when `import.meta.env.VITE_PSEUDO_LOCALES === "1"`.
  - `setLocale` lazily imports the catalog, then sets `document.documentElement.lang` and `.dir = directionOf(locale)` without reloading.
  - `formatRelative` uses `Intl.RelativeTimeFormat` when `now − i < 7 days` (seconds → "now", then minutes, hours, days), and otherwise `formatInstant` as a date.
  - `t` wraps string values in F-312 `isolate`.

#### F-207: pseudo-locale generator
- **File:** `apps/web/scripts/pseudoLocales.ts` (runs in `vite build` and `dev` when `VITE_PSEUDO_LOCALES=1`)
- **Signatures:** `export function toAccented(icuMessage: string): string`, `export function toRtlPseudo(icuMessage: string): string`
- **Behaviour:** both preserve ICU syntax (arguments, plural and select keywords, and tags) by transforming only literal text segments of the parsed AST.
  - `toAccented` maps ASCII letters to accented look-alikes (a→á, e→é, i→í, o→ó, u→ú, A→Á, …, c→ç, n→ñ). Each literal gains `~` padding: one per 3 characters, which reaches +30% when combined with brackets. The result is wrapped as `[…]`.
  - `toRtlPseudo` wraps each literal segment with RLM (U+200F) at both ends, keeping English letters, so the layout flips while the text stays readable.
  - Outputs `src/i18n/generated/{en-XA,ar-XB}.json` (gitignored).

#### F-209: `ErrorFallback` (S-2)
- **File:** `ui/ErrorFallback.tsx`
- **Signature:** `export function ErrorFallback(props: { error: AppError; requestId?: string; onRetry: () => Promise<void> }): JSX.Element`
- **Behaviour:** described in §8.1 S-2.

#### F-210: `UpdateNotifier` (J-6)
- **File:** `ui/UpdateNotifier.tsx`
- **Signature:** `export function UpdateNotifier(props: { buildNumber: number; fetchVersion?: () => Promise<{ buildNumber: number }>; now?: () => number; schedule?: (fn: () => void, ms: number) => () => void }): JSX.Element`
- **Behaviour:** checks `/version.json` on `window` focus (at most once per 60 s) and every 30 minutes. If the fetched `buildNumber` is greater than its own, shows the toast (`update.web.available`, button `update.web.reload`, which calls `location.reload()`). After the global `clientUpdateRequired` signal (F-201), shows a persistent banner (`role="alert"`) with the same button. It never reloads automatically. Fetch failures are ignored silently.

#### F-211: `OfflineBanner` (C-1, web)
- **File:** `ui/OfflineBanner.tsx`
- **Behaviour:**
  - Listens to `online`/`offline` events and `navigator.onLine`.
  - **Offline:** a banner `role="status"` `aria-live="polite"` with `offline.banner.web` ("You're offline.") and an icon.
  - **Back online:** the text changes to `offline.back` ("Back online.") for 3 seconds, then the banner hides.

#### F-212: toasts
- **File:** `ui/Toaster.tsx`
- **Signatures:** `export function showToast(t: { message: string; tone: "info" | "error" | "success"; action?: { label: string; onClick: () => void }; persistent?: boolean }): string`, `export function dismissToast(id: string): void`
- **Behaviour:** uses Kobalte's `Toast` region (`aria-live="polite"`; `assertive` for `error`). Non-persistent toasts close after 6 s, paused on hover or focus.

#### F-213: form error helpers
- **File:** `ui/forms.tsx`
- **Signatures:** `export function FieldError(props: { id: string; message?: string }): JSX.Element`, `export function FormErrorSummary(props: { messages: readonly { fieldId?: string; text: string }[] }): JSX.Element`, `export function applyServerIssues(issues: readonly Issue[], fields: Readonly<Record<string, { id: string; label: string; setError: (m: string) => void }>>, t: …): { summary: { fieldId?: string; text: string }[] }`
- **Behaviour:**
  - `FieldError` renders an icon plus text with `id` for `aria-describedby`.
  - `FormErrorSummary` renders `role="alert"`, receives focus when it changes, and each entry links to its field.
  - `applyServerIssues` maps each issue whose `path.join(".")` names a field to `setError(translated issue message)`, where the issue `code` maps to a `validation.<code>` message ID with a fallback to `validation.invalid`. The summary holds `error.validation.form`, plus one entry per issue that names no field: `error.validation.unknownField` with `{ label }` (the field label, or the path text if unknown).

#### F-214: rate-limit notice (J-3)
- **File:** `ui/RateLimitNotice.tsx`
- **Signature:** `export function createRateLimitGate(now?: () => number): { blockedFor: Accessor<number>; block(retryAfterSeconds: number): void }` and `export function RateLimitNotice(props: { secondsLeft: number }): JSX.Element`
- **Behaviour:** `block` sets an expiry. `blockedFor` is the seconds remaining (ticks every second, 0 when expired). The form's submit is `disabled` while `blockedFor() > 0`. The notice text is `error.rateLimited` with `minutes = ceil(seconds / 60)`, in `role="status"`.

#### F-215: icon registry
- **File:** `ui/icons/registry.ts`, `ui/icons/Icon.tsx`
- **Signatures:** `export const icons: Record<IconName, { svg: Component<JSX.SvgSVGAttributes<SVGSVGElement>>; mirrorInRtl: boolean }>`; `export function Icon(props: { name: IconName; label?: string; class?: string }): JSX.Element`
- **Behaviour:** renders the SVG with `aria-hidden="true"` when there's no `label`, otherwise `role="img"` and `aria-label`. Adds the class `rtl:-scale-x-100` and `data-rtl-probe="mirror"` when `mirrorInRtl`, else `data-rtl-probe="no-mirror"`. The platform's initial icons are `alert`, `info`, `offline`, `refresh` (no mirror), `chevron-start`, `chevron-end`, `arrow-back` (mirror) and `check` (no mirror).

#### F-216: router
- **File:** `router.tsx`
- **Behaviour:** TanStack Router (code-based):
  - `rootRoute` with `errorComponent` = `ErrorFallback` (F-209), with `onRetry` = `router.invalidate()`;
  - `/` → `HomePlaceholder`: an `<h1>` "Budmon" and the paragraph `home.placeholder` ("Nothing here yet."), replaced by `identity`;
  - `notFoundComponent` → `NotFound`: `<h1>` `error.notFound.title` "Page not found" and a "Go to home" link;
  - fixtures route `/__fixtures/*`, registered only when `import.meta.env.VITE_FIXTURES === "1"` (S-12).
  - Search params are validated with zod schemas that accept only URL-safe values (D-24).
  - On navigation, focus moves to the new page's `<h1>` (`tabindex="-1"`) and the title is announced through the live region (F-218).

#### F-217: web Sentry
- **File:** `observability/sentry.ts`
- **Signatures:** `export function initWebSentry(cfg: { dsn?: string; release: string; environment: string }): void`, `export function scrubWebEvent(e: Record<string, unknown>): Record<string, unknown> | null`
- **Behaviour:** `@sentry/solid` `init` with `sendDefaultPii: false`, `integrations: []` beyond the defaults (no browser tracing: no client spans in the MVP, D-24), no Replay, `beforeSend: scrubWebEvent`, and `beforeBreadcrumb` keeping only `navigation` and `fetch`/`xhr` with URLs stripped to the path. `scrubWebEvent` applies F-35's allowlist, plus `request.url` stripped to the path and the transaction name stripped of the query. Error values are replaced by the error key (when it's an oRPC defined error) or the class name: never `message`.

#### F-218: accessibility helpers
- **File:** `ui/a11y.ts`
- **Signature:** `export function announce(text: string, politeness?: "polite" | "assertive"): void`
- **Behaviour:** writes to a visually hidden live region (`#live-polite` or `#live-assertive`) after clearing it, so repeats are announced.

#### F-219: `VirtualTable` (S-12)
- **File:** `ui/table/VirtualTable.tsx`
- **Signature:** `export function VirtualTable<T>(props: { label: string; columns: readonly { id: string; header: string; cell: (row: T) => JSX.Element; align?: "start" | "end" }[]; source: InfiniteListSource<T>; rowHeight: number; getRowId: (row: T) => string; onRowActivate?: (row: T) => void }): JSX.Element`
- **Behaviour:**
  - A `role="grid"` element with `aria-label`, `aria-rowcount` (`source.totalCount() ?? -1`) and `aria-colcount`. TanStack Table v9 provides headers and cells; TanStack Virtual renders rows with a fixed `rowHeight` and `overscan: 10`.
  - Each rendered row has `role="row"` and `aria-rowindex` = absolute index + 2 (the header row is 1). Cells have `role="gridcell"`. Columns with `align: "end"` use `text-end`.
  - Rows whose page isn't in memory render as placeholder rows (same height, `aria-busy="true"`, `data-placeholder`).
  - When a placeholder page scrolls into view, `source.ensurePage(pageIndex)` is called. When the last loaded row is within 20 rows of the viewport end, the next page is requested.
  - **Keyboard:** ArrowUp/ArrowDown move focus between rows and scroll the focused row into view; Home/End go to the first or last loaded row; Enter calls `onRowActivate`. ArrowLeft/ArrowRight move between cells, reversed in RTL (D-38 rule 11).

#### F-220: `createInfiniteList`
- **File:** `ui/table/infiniteList.ts`
- **Signature:** `export interface InfiniteListSource<T> { rowCount(): number; totalCount(): number | null; rowAt(index: number): T | undefined; ensurePage(pageIndex: number): void; loading(): boolean; error(): AppError | null }; export function createInfiniteList<T>(opts: { fetchPage: (cursor: string | null) => Promise<{ items: T[]; nextCursor: string | null }>; pageSize: number; maxPagesInMemory?: number }): InfiniteListSource<T>`
- **Behaviour:**
  - Fetches pages sequentially by cursor and records each page's starting cursor. `rowCount()` = rows known so far (loaded plus dropped).
  - When more than `maxPagesInMemory` (default 50) pages are loaded, the page farthest from the last requested page is dropped; its rows read as `undefined` (placeholders) and `rowCount` is unchanged.
  - `ensurePage(i)` refetches a dropped page from its recorded starting cursor; its rows take the same indexes.
  - Errors set `error()` and stop automatic fetching until `ensurePage` is called again.

#### F-221: `version.json` and build number
- **File:** `apps/web/vite.config.ts` (plugin `budmonVersion`)
- **Behaviour:** reads `BUDMON_BUILD_NUMBER` (default `0` outside release builds), defines `import.meta.env.VITE_BUILD_NUMBER`, and emits `dist/version.json` with `{"buildNumber":<n>}`.

### 4.19 Android (S-13)

Package `com.budmon.app`, under `apps/android/app/src/main/java/com/budmon/app/`. Hilt modules provide every dependency; constructor injection throughout.

| ID | Class / function (file) | Behaviour |
| -- | ----------------------- | --------- |
| F-250 | `BudmonApp : Application` (`BudmonApp.kt`) | `@HiltAndroidApp`. Initialises Sentry (F-260) when `BuildConfig.SENTRY_DSN` isn't empty, then the WorkManager configuration (Hilt worker factory), then schedules F-255's periodic sync (unique work `outbox-sync`, every 15 min, `NetworkType.CONNECTED`). |
| F-251 | `ClientHeaderInterceptor(versionCode: Int)`, `TraceparentInterceptor(random)`, `IdempotencyKeyInterceptor` (`core/network/Interceptors.kt`) | Add `X-Budmon-Client: android/<versionCode>`, and `traceparent` with random ids. `IdempotencyKeyInterceptor` reads the request tag `IdempotencyKey(value: UUID)` and sets `Idempotency-Key` (lower-case); with no tag it adds nothing. |
| F-252 | `ApiErrorParser.parse(code: Int, body: ByteArray?): ApiError` (`core/network/ApiError.kt`) | `sealed interface ApiError { data class Defined(val key: String, val status: Int, val data: JsonObject?); object Unavailable; object Network; object Timeout; object Unknown }`. A body matching the envelope (`defined: true`, string `code`) → `Defined`. Otherwise status 502, 503 or 504 → `Unavailable`; other statuses ≥ 500 → `Defined("INTERNAL", status, null)`; other statuses → `Unknown`. `IOException` → `Network`; `SocketTimeoutException` → `Timeout` (mapped by the caller). |
| F-253 | `ErrorMessages.forError(error: ApiError, op: Operation): UiText` (`core/error/ErrorMessages.kt`) | Same mapping as F-203, to `R.string` resources with the same keys (dots → underscores). `UiText` holds a resource id and arguments. |
| F-254 | `OutboxEntry` (`@Entity("outbox")`) and `OutboxDao` (`core/outbox/`) | Columns: `id: Long` (PK autogen), `idempotencyKey: String` (unique), `method: String`, `path: String`, `body: ByteArray`, `contentType: String`, `createdAtEpochMs: Long`, `status: String` (`PENDING`, `SENDING`, `FAILED`, `NEEDS_CONFIRMATION`, `PAUSED`), `lastErrorKey: String?`, `attempts: Int`. DAO: `insert`, `pendingOldestFirst(limit)`, `markStatus(id, status, errorKey)`, `delete(id)`, `observeCounts(): Flow<OutboxCounts>` (pending, failed, needsConfirmation), and (A-23) `@Query("DELETE FROM outbox") suspend fun deleteAll(): Int` (returns the rows deleted) and `@Query("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM outbox") suspend fun countAll(): Int`, both across every status. Room database `budmon.db`, version 1, schema exported to `app/schemas/`. |
| F-255 | `OutboxRepository.enqueue(method, path, body: ByteArray, contentType): Long`, `OutboxRepository.kick()` and `SyncWorker : CoroutineWorker` (`core/outbox/`) | `enqueue` stores **the exact bytes** with a new random UUID and `PENDING`, then calls `kick()`. `kick()` = `WorkManager.enqueueUniqueWork("outbox-sync-now", KEEP, oneTime with NetworkType.CONNECTED)`. Worker rules below the table. |
| F-256 | `Money`, `Rational`, `roundHalfEven`, `allocate`, `convertWithRates`, `formatMoney` (`core/money/`) | Kotlin mirrors of F-300 to F-305: `BigInteger` minor units, `java.math` exact rationals, `android.icu.text.NumberFormat` with `setMinimumFractionDigits`/`setMaximumFractionDigits(minorUnits)` formatting a `BigDecimal`. `toString()` returns `"[redacted]"`. Passes the shared test vectors (TP-13.9). |
| F-257 | `UpdateRepository` (`core/update/`) | `refresh()` calls `GET meta/client-config` (generated client), stores the result in DataStore, and computes `UpdateState`: `Required(min)` if `versionCode < minimumVersionCode`; `Available(latest)` if `< latestVersionCode` and not dismissed within 3 days; else `None`. `markRequired(min)` is called by the error path on `CLIENT_UPDATE_REQUIRED`. `dismissAvailable()` records the time. Exposes `state: StateFlow<UpdateState>`. |
| F-258 | Compose UI: `OfflineBanner`, `SyncIndicator`, `SyncChip`, `ErrorFallbackScreen`, `UpdateRequiredScreen`, `UpdateCard` (`ui/platform/`) | §8.2. |
| F-259 | `ConnectivityMonitor` (`core/network/ConnectivityMonitor.kt`) | `isOnline: StateFlow<Boolean>` from `ConnectivityManager.registerDefaultNetworkCallback` (`NET_CAPABILITY_VALIDATED`). |
| F-260 | `SentryScrubber : SentryOptions.BeforeSendCallback` (`core/observability/`) | Sentry options: `isSendDefaultPii = false`, `isAttachScreenshot = false`, `isAttachViewHierarchy = false`, `maxBreadcrumbs = 20`, `beforeBreadcrumb` keeps navigation and HTTP with the URL path only. `beforeSend` keeps F-35's allowlisted fields, replaces each exception `value` with the type (or the API error key), and clears `request`, `extra`, contexts other than trace, and user fields other than `id`. |
| F-261 | `ComposeTextLiteralDetector` (`apps/android/lint-rules/src/main/java/com/budmon/lint/`) | Lint issue `BudmonHardcodedComposeText` (error): reports a string literal or string template passed as the `text` argument of `androidx.compose.material3.Text`/`BasicText`, or as `contentDescription` of any composable, or to `Modifier.semantics { contentDescription = … }`. Allows `stringResource(...)`, `pluralStringResource(...)` and variables. |
| F-262 | `res/xml/data_extraction_rules.xml`, `backup_rules.xml` | Exclude `database/budmon.db*` and `sharedpref`/DataStore files from cloud backup and device transfer. |
| F-263 | Locale and RTL | `android:supportsRtl="true"`; `res/xml/locales_config.xml` with `en`; `pseudoLocalesEnabled true` in the debug build type; lint `RtlHardcoded`, `RtlCompat`, `RtlEnabled`, `HardcodedText` and `SetTextI18n` as errors; the accessibility lint category non-fatal (`warning`, D-39). |
| F-264 | API base URL (`app/build.gradle.kts`, `core/network/ApiBaseUrl.kt`) | `buildConfigField("String", "API_BASE_URL", …)` from the Gradle property `budmon.apiBaseUrl`. Debug builds default to `http://10.0.2.2:5173/`: the **development** stack's Vite server (F-22), reached through the emulator's alias for Windows' `localhost` and WSL2's localhost forwarding. Never port 8080, which is the laptop's production Caddy (HLD D-29). A debug build may override the property, but only with an `http://10.0.2.2:<port>/` URL whose port isn't 8080 (the Gradle script fails otherwise), so no debug build can reach production; the emulator or phone reaches production only through a `stage0` release build. **Release builds fail** (a `require` in the Gradle script) if the property is missing or isn't an `https://` URL ending in `/`. Stage-0 release builds read it from `~/.budmon/android.properties` (`budmon.apiBaseUrl=https://<laptop>.<tailnet>.ts.net/`, never committed); from stage 1 it's `https://budmon.com/`. `res/xml/network_security_config.xml` allows cleartext only to `10.0.2.2` and only in the debug build type. Retrofit and the outbox (F-255) use `BuildConfig.API_BASE_URL` + `api/v1/`. |
| F-265 (A-3) | Google sign-in server client id (`app/build.gradle.kts`) | `buildConfigField("String", "GOOGLE_SERVER_CLIENT_ID", …)` from the Gradle property `budmon.googleServerClientId` (the "Budmon sign-in" web client id, used by Credential Manager as `serverClientId`; identity's LLD uses it). Optional: missing → empty string (identity then hides Google sign-in on Android). When present it must match `^[0-9]+-[a-z0-9]+\.apps\.googleusercontent\.com$` or the build fails naming the property. Stage-0 release builds read it from `~/.budmon/android.properties` with `budmon.apiBaseUrl`; never committed. |

**F-255 `SyncWorker` rules:**
- On start, entries left in `SENDING` (the process died mid-send) are reset to `PENDING`. Resending is safe because the idempotency key is unchanged.
- Processes `PENDING` entries oldest first.
- An entry older than 60 days → `NEEDS_CONFIRMATION`, not sent.
- If `UpdateState` is `Required` → stops and leaves entries `PENDING`.
- Otherwise sends `method path` with the stored bytes, `Content-Type` and `Idempotency-Key = idempotencyKey`, through the generated client's OkHttp instance (raw request).
- Responses:

  | Response | Action |
  | -------- | ------ |
  | 2xx (including replays) | Delete the entry. |
  | `CLIENT_UPDATE_REQUIRED` | `UpdateRepository.markRequired`, stop; entries stay `PENDING`. |
  | 429 or `RATE_LIMITED` | Stop and return `Result.retry()`. |
  | 401 `UNAUTHENTICATED` | Stop; entries stay `PENDING` (an expired session isn't the entry's fault). `Result.success()`; the next sync runs after `identity` signals a new session (`OutboxRepository.kick()`), or at the periodic run. |
  | `Unavailable` | Stop and return `Result.retry()`. |
  | Other 4xx | `FAILED` with the error key. |
  | 5xx, `Network` or `Timeout` | Stop and return `Result.retry()` (WorkManager exponential backoff from 30 s). |

- `attempts` is incremented on every send.

**Generated client:** `apps/android/app/build.gradle.kts` applies `org.openapi.generator` 7.14.0 with `generatorName = "kotlin"`, `library = "jvm-retrofit2"`, `serializationLibrary = "kotlinx_serialization"`, `inputSpec = "$rootDir/../../packages/contract/openapi.json"`, `outputDir = build/generated/openapi`, `packageName = "com.budmon.api"`. `preBuild` depends on `openApiGenerate`. The output is never committed.

## 5. API contract

### 5.1 Conventions for every procedure

- **Base URL:** `https://<domain>/api/v1` (D-36). JSON only (`Content-Type: application/json`).
- **Request headers the platform reads:**

  | Header | Rule |
  | ------ | ---- |
  | `X-Budmon-Client` | F-56. |
  | `Idempotency-Key` | Creates only (F-102). |
  | `traceparent` | Optional. |
  | Authentication | `identity`'s. |
- **Response headers on every `/api/v1` response:** `X-Request-Id` and `X-Budmon-API-Version: 1.<minor>`, plus helmet's headers (F-61). On replays: `Idempotent-Replayed: true`. On 429: `Retry-After`.
- **Error envelope** (oRPC OpenAPI, F-52). The body is exactly:
  ```json
  { "defined": true, "code": "<KEY>", "status": <http status>, "message": "<fixed developer message>", "data": <object, present only when the error defines data> }
  ```
  `message` is the fixed text in §6, never derived from input or exceptions.
- **Creates** (F-343): `POST`, `201`, body `{ "id": "<uuid>", "createdAt": "<RFC 3339 Z>" }`, header `Idempotency-Key` required.
- **Lists** (F-344): input `{ …filters, cursor?, limit? (1..100, default 50) }`; output `{ "items": [...], "nextCursor": string | null }`.
- **Every procedure** may also return `UNAUTHENTICATED` (unless public), `CLIENT_UPDATE_REQUIRED`, `RATE_LIMITED` (the coarse limit), `PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE`, `VALIDATION_FAILED`, `INTERNAL` and `SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE`.

### 5.2 `GET /api/v1/meta/client-config`, procedure `meta.clientConfig`
- **Transport:** REST over oRPC's OpenAPI handler (query).
- **Handler:** F-58.
- **Auth:** public (`PUBLIC_PROCEDURES`). Exempt from the client-version check.
- **Request:** no parameters.
- **Response 200:**
  ```json
  { "apiVersion": "1.0",
    "android": { "minimumVersionCode": 0, "latestVersionCode": 0, "downloadUrl": null },
    "web": { "minimumBuild": 0 } }
  ```
- **Errors:**

  | Error key | Status | When |
  | --------- | ------ | ---- |
  | `RATE_LIMITED` | 429 | More than 300 requests a minute from one IP (coarse limit). |
  | `SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE` | 503 | Maintenance switch on (answered by Caddy). |

### 5.3 Non-contract routes

| Route | Handler | Auth | Response |
| ----- | ------- | ---- | -------- |
| `GET /health/live` | F-57 | none | `200 {"status":"ok"}`. Reachable only inside the Docker network; Caddy doesn't proxy it. |
| `GET /health/ready` | F-57 / Caddy | none | `200 {"status":"ready"}`; `503 {"status":"not_ready","reason":"database_unreachable"\|"schema_behind"\|"schema_ahead"}`; `503 {"status":"maintenance"}` from Caddy. |
| `GET /version.json` | Caddy static file | none | `200 {"buildNumber":n}`, `Cache-Control: no-store`. |
| `GET /dev/objects/:token` | F-145 | signed token | Development only. `Content-Disposition: attachment`, with `filename="<n>"` when the token names the file (A-22). |
| Module routes (A-26) | registered through `ApiContainer.moduleRoutes` (F-55 step 4b) | the module's | Each is specified in its module's LLD and listed here when it's an exception to a platform rule (as the Google callback below is). |
| `OPTIONS /api/v1/*` | F-52 rule 4 | none | `404 NOT_FOUND` envelope (no CORS). |
| `GET /api/v1/auth/google/callback?code&state` (A-4) | `identity` | none (single-use `state`) | Specified by `identity`. **The one stated exception to HLD D-24 rule 4:** Google's redirect necessarily puts `code` and `state` in the query string. Mitigations: the code is single-use, bound to the PKCE verifier and client secret and exchanged within seconds; `state` is single-use; F-37/F-38 and Caddy's log filter (F-175) drop query strings from request logs, spans and Sentry URLs; `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`; a `303` away from the URL. The contract rule R4 (F-348) covers contract procedures only and is unaffected. |

## 6. Error catalog

| Class (file) | Key | Status | `message` (fixed) | `data` | Thrown by | When |
| ------------ | --- | ------ | ----------------- | ------ | --------- | ---- |
| `ValidationFailedError` (`platform/errors/platformErrors.ts`) | `VALIDATION_FAILED` | 400 | "Validation failed" | `{ issues }` | F-52 (input validation), F-62 (bad JSON, unsupported media type), F-102 (bad Idempotency-Key), F-103 (bad cursor) | Input doesn't match the contract. |
| `ClientUpdateRequiredError` | `CLIENT_UPDATE_REQUIRED` | 400 | "Client update required" | `{ minimumVersion }` | F-56 | Client version below the configured minimum. |
| `UnauthenticatedError` | `UNAUTHENTICATED` | 401 | "Authentication required" | none | F-53 | A non-public procedure without a principal. |
| `ForbiddenError` | `FORBIDDEN` | 403 | "Forbidden" | none | F-53 (`ownerProcedure`), modules | The caller can't change the resource. |
| `NotFoundError` | `NOT_FOUND` | 404 | "Not found" | none | F-52 (unmatched route), F-145, modules | The resource doesn't exist or isn't visible. |
| `ConflictError` | `CONFLICT` | 409 | "Conflict" | optional | Modules | State conflict. |
| `IdempotencyKeyReusedError` | `IDEMPOTENCY_KEY_REUSED` | 409 | "Idempotency key reused with a different request" | none | F-100 | Same key, different procedure or input. |
| `PayloadTooLargeError` | `PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE` | 413 | "Payload too large" | none | F-62 | Body over the limit. |
| `RateLimitedError` | `RATE_LIMITED` | 429 | "Too many requests" (developer message; users see the clients' `error.rateLimited`, A-191) | `{ retryAfterSeconds }` | F-65 | Limit exceeded. |
| (built by F-52) | `INTERNAL` | 500 | "Internal error" | `{ outcome }` | F-52, F-62 | Any non-`BudmonError` failure. |
| `ServiceUnavailableError` | `SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE` | 503 | "Service unavailable" | `{ outcome }` | F-52 rule 5; Caddy maintenance | The database is unavailable, or maintenance is on. |

**Internal (non-HTTP) error classes**, all plain `Error` subclasses that F-52 maps to `INTERNAL` if they ever reach the API:

| Class | File | Thrown by |
| ----- | ---- | --------- |
| `ConfigError` | `platform/config/loadConfig.ts` | F-11 |
| `SchemaStepError(code, subject?)` with `readonly code` and `readonly subject: string \| undefined`, message `schema step failed: <code>[ (<subject>)]` (A-52), codes `invalid_verifier`, `password_form_in_production`, `table_without_grants`, `credential_table_granted_to_capture`, `minor_units_changed`, `queue_schema_ahead`, `queue_policy_changed`, `role_attributes_unexpected` (A-77), `table_missing` (A-179) | `platform/db/schemaStep.ts` | F-15, F-16, F-21, F-74, F-75 |
| `PushTargetNotEmptyError` | `platform/db/schemaPush.ts` | F-17 |
| `UnknownMigrationError` | `platform/db/migrations.ts` | F-18 |
| `JournalInvalidError` (A-150) | `platform/db/migrations.ts` | F-18 (`readJournal`) |
| `ResetRefusedError` (`readonly reason`, A-84) | `platform/db/reset.ts` | F-20 (`resetDevelopmentDatabase`, `seedDevelopmentDatabase`, A-14) |
| `JobPayloadInvalidError`, `UnsafeJobPayloadError`, `MissingQueueError`, `JobFailure` | `platform/queue/*` | F-72, F-73, F-76, F-78 |

## 7. Integrations

### 7.1 Google Cloud KMS
- **Client:** `@google-cloud/kms` `KeyManagementServiceClient({ credentials: <service-account JSON>, apiEndpoint: "cloudkms.googleapis.com" })`.
- **Call:** `asymmetricDecrypt({ name: <keyVersion>, ciphertext: <wrapped DEK> })`, timeout 5 s, no client-side retry (the job retries).
- **Key:** `projects/<p>/locations/europe-west3/keyRings/budmon/cryptoKeys/capture-credentials/cryptoKeyVersions/<n>`, algorithm `RSA_DECRYPT_OAEP_3072_SHA256`.
- **Public key:** fetched by the owner (`gcloud kms keys versions get-public-key`) into `CAPTURE_PUBLIC_KEY_FILE`, which isn't secret but is kept with the deployment's secrets so it changes with the key version.

### 7.2 Google OAuth token endpoint
- **Call:** F-120. `POST https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token`, form-encoded, timeout 10 s, no automatic retry inside the function.
- **Ownership:** the job that calls it (owned by `sources`) decides on retries from `retryable`.

### 7.3 FX providers
- **Calls:** F-133 and F-137.
- **Primary:** Open Exchange Rates historical endpoint; `app_id` from `FX_PRIMARY_APP_ID_FILE`; about 31 requests a month.
- **Fallback:** `fawazahmed0` via jsDelivr, with the Cloudflare Pages mirror; no key.
- **Schedule:** daily at 00:30 UTC. Retries every 30 min; the fallback after 6 h.
- **Timeouts:** 10 s per request.
- **Idempotency:** stored days are final (`ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`).

### 7.4 Backblaze B2 (S3 API)
- **Stage 0:** two buckets, `budmon-exports` (lifecycle: delete after 8 days) and `budmon-erasure-log` (Object Lock 30 days if available, lifecycle 31 days), in region `eu-central-003`, created by the owner in the B2 web console (runbook `stage0-laptop.md`). Application keys:
  - exports read-only → `api` (presigning);
  - exports read-write and erasure-log write-only → `worker-general`.

  AWS SDK v3 against `S3_ENDPOINT` (`https://s3.eu-central-003.backblazeb2.com`). Within B2's free 10 GB. **No database backups go to B2 in stage 0** (HLD D-30).
- **From stage 1:** the backups bucket, the pgBackRest repository and the OpenTofu-managed keys are specified in the stage-1 LLD.

### 7.5 Sentry (stage 0) and Grafana Cloud (from stage 1)
- **Sentry:** one organisation, with projects `budmon-server`, `budmon-web` and `budmon-android`; DSNs are in configuration. The **default issue alert** ("a new issue is created" → e-mail to the owner) stays on; in stage 0 it's the owner's only notification channel (HLD D-25). Source maps for web are uploaded in CI with `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` (a CI secret only).
- **Stage 0 has no Grafana Cloud, no Alloy and no alert rules.** `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` is unset on the laptop, so telemetry stays in-process (F-36). The application-side metrics and drop counters still exist and are tested.
- **From stage 1:** Alloy, Grafana Cloud, the synthetic check and the alert rules (the v0.5 rule table: API down, worker heartbeat, API errors, dead-lettered jobs, no new FX day, KMS errors, disk, memory, Postgres connections, backup overdue, WAL archiving, certificate expiry, unexpected telemetry drops, Gmail backlog and staleness) are specified in the stage-1 LLD.
- `fx_last_day_timestamp_seconds` (F-42; the epoch seconds of the latest stored `rate_date` + 1 day) exists from day one.
- **Stale Gmail connections in stage 0 (HLD D-25 v1.2):** with no alert rules, `sources` reports a connection becoming stale (no successful sync for 24 hours) as one Sentry event per connection per staleness episode, through F-34's `report` with a `BudmonError` keyed `CAPTURE_CONNECTION_STALE` and only the connection id in the context; Sentry's new-issue e-mail is the alert. The platform needs nothing beyond F-34; the requirement is on the `sources` LLD.

### 7.6 Tailscale (stage 0)
- Tailscale runs on Windows, not in a container. The tailnet has MagicDNS and HTTPS certificates enabled.
- `tailscale serve --bg --https=443 http://127.0.0.1:8080` publishes the laptop's Caddy at `https://<laptop>.<tailnet>.ts.net` to the tailnet only. Tailscale obtains and renews the Let's Encrypt certificate.
- The phone runs the Tailscale app, always on. At home the connection goes directly over the LAN.
- Nothing in Budmon's code knows about Tailscale. `PUBLIC_ORIGIN` and the Android base URL are the only places the name appears (configuration, F-175, F-264).
- If the name changes (a renamed machine or tailnet), `site.env` is updated and the Android app is rebuilt.

### 7.7 Container registry and signing
- **Stage 0:** none. `budmon-local` builds images locally from the tag (F-178).
- **From stage 1:** GitHub Container Registry, cosign signing after the rehearsal, offline verification by the hosts (stage-1 LLD; HLD D-29 rule 4).

### 7.8 Email (SMTP) and Google sign-in endpoints (A-2, A-3, A-5)
- **Stage 0:** worker-general sends through `SMTP_URL`; by default the laptop's Mailpit (`smtp://mailpit:1025`, no TLS, no auth; the inbox at `http://127.0.0.1:8025` on the laptop). The owner may point `SMTP_URL`, `SMTP_PASSWORD` and `EMAIL_FROM` at any relay (configuration only). The `EmailSender` adapter, templates and jobs are `identity`'s.
- **Google sign-in:** the API calls `https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token` and fetches Google's JWKS from `https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v3/certs` (identity's adapters), through F-121-style guarded fetch with a 10 s timeout and the standard proxy variables (F-122).
- **Egress list for the stage-1 firewall work (A-5; HLD D-29, D-19):** API → `oauth2.googleapis.com:443`, `www.googleapis.com:443` (in addition to Sentry); worker-general → the chosen email provider's SMTP host on 587 or 465. The stage-1 LLD writes these into the host firewall and proxy rules.

## 8. Frontend

### 8.1 Web

**Stack and files:** F-200 to F-221. Tailwind with logical utilities only (F-2). Kobalte for the toast region, dialogs and menus (DV-3).

**Routes:**

| Path | Component | Notes |
| ---- | --------- | ----- |
| `/` | `HomePlaceholder` | Replaced by `identity` / `accounts`. |
| (not found) | `NotFound` | |
| `/__fixtures/virtual-table` | `VirtualTableFixture` | Only when `VITE_FIXTURES=1`: 100,000 synthetic rows served by an MSW handler implementing keyset paging (S-12 performance test). |
| `/__fixtures/rtl-probe` | `RtlProbeFixture` | Only with `VITE_FIXTURES=1`: renders every platform component (banner, toast, error fallback, form errors, icons) for the pseudo-RTL run. |

**Component tree:**

```
App (F-200)
├─ I18nProvider (F-206)
│  └─ QueryClientProvider (F-204)
│     ├─ OfflineBanner (F-211)            – fixed at the top, above the router outlet
│     ├─ RouterProvider (F-216)
│     │  └─ rootRoute layout: <header><main id="main"><h1 tabindex=-1/>…</main>
│     │     └─ errorComponent: ErrorFallback (F-209)
│     ├─ UpdateNotifier (F-210)           – toast or persistent banner
│     ├─ Toaster (F-212)
│     └─ live regions #live-polite, #live-assertive (F-218)
```

**UX states and feedback** (HLD §4):

| Behaviour | Implementation | Test |
| --------- | -------------- | ---- |
| **S-2 error fallback** | `<h1>` `error.fallback.title` ("Something went wrong on our side"); body `error.fallback.body`; button **Try again** (`error.fallback.retry`) calling `onRetry`. While retrying, the button shows a spinner and has `aria-busy="true"` and `disabled`. If the retry fails, `error.fallback.stillFailing` ("Still not working.") is appended. The link **Go to home** (`error.fallback.home`) goes to `/`. `Reference: {ref}` (`error.reference`) shows the first 8 characters of `requestId` when present, inside `<bdi dir="ltr">`. | TP-11.7, TP-11.8 |
| **J-1 generic errors in forms and toasts** | F-203 picks the message. Read failures on a whole screen use S-2; mutation failures show a toast (`tone: "error"`). Form input is kept. A create with outcome `unknown` keeps **Try again** enabled. The retry reuses the same idempotency key while the input is unchanged (F-205), so it can't create a duplicate. | TP-11.3 to TP-11.5 |
| **J-2 validation** | F-213: field outline (`aria-invalid="true"`), icon plus message below (`aria-describedby`), focus to the first invalid field, `FormErrorSummary` (`role="alert"`) for unmapped fields. | TP-11.9 |
| **J-3 rate limit** | F-214: notice plus a disabled submit with the remaining minutes in text. | TP-11.10 |
| **J-6 web update** | F-210. | TP-11.11, TP-11.12 |
| **J-7 unavailable** | `SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE` or network → `error.unavailable` in a toast or in S-2. | TP-11.5 |
| **C-1 offline (web)** | F-211. | TP-11.13 |
| **Accessibility** | Landmarks (`header`, `main`, `nav` when present); focus on route change (F-216); live regions (F-218); contrast checked on the design tokens in `apps/web/src/ui/tokens.css` by `tools/ci/checkContrast.ts` (report-only, D-39); axe in every Playwright test (report-only, D-39). | TP-11.14, TP-11.15 |
| **Responsive layout** | 360 px to desktop. The platform's screens are single-column with `max-inline-size: 40rem` centred; nothing overflows horizontally at 360 px. | TP-11.16 |
| **RTL** | `dir` from the locale (F-206); logical utilities (F-2); icons (F-215); bidi isolation (F-206 `t`, `<bdi>` for references). | TP-11.17, TP-11.18 |

**Web message catalog** (`apps/web/src/i18n/messages/en.json`, the platform's IDs):

| ID | English |
| -- | ------- |
| `error.generic.notChanged` | Something went wrong on our side. Nothing was changed. Try again in a moment. |
| `error.generic.unknownOutcome` | We couldn't confirm this was saved. Check before trying again. |
| `error.generic.read` | Something went wrong on our side. Try again in a moment. |
| `error.reference` | Reference: {ref} |
| `error.validation.form` | Some details need fixing. |
| `error.validation.unknownField` | Something in this form isn't valid: {label} |
| `error.rateLimited` | {minutes, plural, one {Too many attempts. Try again in # minute.} other {Too many attempts. Try again in # minutes.}} |
| `error.unavailable` | Budmon is temporarily unavailable. Try again in a few minutes. |
| `error.notFound` | This item doesn't exist or you no longer have access to it. |
| `error.notFound.title` | Page not found |
| `error.forbidden` | You don't have permission to do this. |
| `error.fallback.title` | Something went wrong on our side |
| `error.fallback.body` | Try again in a moment. If it keeps happening, share this reference with the person who invited you. |
| `error.fallback.retry` | Try again |
| `error.fallback.home` | Go to home |
| `error.fallback.stillFailing` | Still not working. |
| `offline.banner.web` | You're offline. |
| `offline.back` | Back online. |
| `update.web.available` | Budmon has been updated. Reload to get the latest version. |
| `update.web.reload` | Reload |
| `update.required.web` | This version of Budmon is out of date. Reload to continue. |
| `home.placeholder` | Nothing here yet. |
| `validation.invalid`, `validation.invalid_type`, `validation.too_small`, `validation.too_big`, `validation.invalid_format`, `validation.unrecognized_keys` | "Enter a valid value." / "Enter a valid value." / "This is too short or too small." / "This is too long or too large." / "Check the format." / "Remove the unexpected field." |

### 8.2 Android

**Screens and components** (Compose, Material 3, `ui/platform/`):

| Component | Behaviour | Strings (`res/values/strings.xml`) |
| --------- | --------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `UpdateRequiredScreen` (S-1) | Full screen, shown by the nav host whenever `UpdateState.Required`. Icon, title, body. The pending-count note shows only when `pending > 0`, with `pluralStringResource` and `999+` above 999 (rendered "1,000+" using the plural resource with a `%s` for the formatted count). Primary button opens `downloadUrl` in a Custom Tab; if it's null or fails, inline text `update_download_failed`. Secondary text button **Record an entry offline** navigates to the route `transactions/new-offline` (registered by `transactions`; until then, the button is hidden). | `update_required_title` "Update Budmon to continue", `update_required_body` "This version is no longer supported. Updating takes about a minute.", `update_required_pending` (plural) "%1$s entries you saved offline are kept and will sync after you update.", `update_required_button` "Update Budmon", `update_required_offline` "Record an entry offline", `update_download_failed` "Couldn't open the download. Ask the person who invited you for the latest version." |
| `UpdateCard` (C-4) | On home when `UpdateState.Available`: text plus **Update** and **Later** (`dismissAvailable`, hidden for 3 days). | `update_available` "A new version of Budmon is available.", `update_action` "Update", `update_later` "Later" |
| `ErrorFallbackScreen` (S-2) | Same behaviour as the web version, with `Reference: %1$s` (LTR isolated with `BidiFormatter`). | `error_fallback_title`, `error_fallback_body`, `error_fallback_retry`, `error_fallback_home`, `error_fallback_still_failing`, `error_reference` |
| `OfflineBanner` (C-1) | Shown when `ConnectivityMonitor.isOnline` is false; `liveRegion = Polite`. "Back online. Syncing %d entries…" for 3 s when connectivity returns and pending > 0, else "Back online." | `offline_banner` "You're offline. New entries are saved on this phone and sync when you're back online.", `offline_nothing_loaded` "You're offline. Connect to see this.", `offline_last_updated` "Offline: last updated %1$s", `back_online_syncing` (plural), `back_online` |
| `SyncIndicator` (C-2) | App-bar chip with an icon and text: "%d waiting to sync" (plural; "99+" above 99); "Syncing %d…" while the worker runs; "%d needs attention" (plural) when failed > 0. Hidden when all counts are 0. TalkBack reads the full text. | `sync_waiting`, `sync_in_progress`, `sync_attention` (plurals) |
| `SyncChip` (C-2) | Per entry: "Not yet synced" / "Couldn't sync: tap to fix" / "Check before syncing", each with an icon. | `chip_not_synced`, `chip_failed`, `chip_needs_confirmation` |

**Error strings:** the same IDs and texts as web §8.1, as `error_generic_not_changed`, `error_generic_unknown_outcome`, `error_generic_read`, `error_validation_form`, `error_rate_limited` (plural), `error_unavailable`, `error_not_found`, `error_forbidden`.

**State:** ViewModels expose `StateFlow`. `UpdateRepository.state`, `OutboxDao.observeCounts()` and `ConnectivityMonitor.isOnline` are app-scoped and combined in `PlatformStatusViewModel`.

**Accessibility:** touch targets ≥ 48 dp (`Modifier.minimumInteractiveComponentSize()`); font scaling to 200% tested; every icon has a `contentDescription` from resources or `null` when decorative; meaning never by colour alone (chips have icon plus text).

## 9. Slices

The platform's slices are **capability slices** rather than one story each. Each one delivers part of one or more stories end to end (code, configuration, tests). They're ordered by dependency. Status for all: not started.

| Slice | Delivers | Depends on |

| S-12 Web virtualised table | D-7 | S-11b |
| S-13 Android skeleton | D-8, J-1, J-2, J-4, J-5 (Android) | S-4, S-7 |
| S-14 Release-migration tooling | US-7 | S-2 |
| S-15 Stage-0 laptop stack | D-29 stage 0 (US-15's stage-0 part: local dumps only, by the user's decision) | S-5 to S-10, S-11b, S-14 |
| S-16 Release rehearsal (stage-0 shape) | D-41 | S-15, S-11b, S-13 |

### S-0: Repository, clean-up, lint and CI skeleton (US-1, US-14, US-12)
- **Depends on:** none
- **Functions:** F-1, F-2 (rule file only; tested in S-11a), F-3 (same), F-3b (same, A-12), F-5, F-6 (including its CLI, A-7); root `package.json` with only S-0's scripts from §2.2.2 (A-14), workspace files including `pnpm-workspace.yaml`'s `peerDependencyRules` (A-13), `.gitignore`, `.gitattributes` (§2.2.1, A-9), root `vitest.config.ts` (§10.1, A-8), README; `.github/workflows/ci.yml` steps 1 to 3, including the `migrations` job's F-6 step (A-7); the removals in §2.1.
- **Scenarios:**

| Scenario | Happy / unhappy | Expected | Tests |
| -------- | --------------- | -------- | ----- |
| Old code and artefacts removed | happy | The paths in §2.1 are absent and `server/dist` isn't tracked. | TP-0.1 |
| Router imports a repo; service imports drizzle | unhappy | Lint fails. | TP-0.2 |
| `pino` imported outside observability; `console` in platform code | unhappy | Lint fails. | TP-0.3 |
| `parseFloat` / `Number()` / `bigint({ mode: "number" })` | unhappy | Lint fails; a described disable passes. | TP-0.4 |
| Migration file changed on a feature branch | unhappy | `checkMigrationFiles` fails; release/hotfix/infra/merge-back branches pass. | TP-0.5 |
| F-6's CLI given missing, duplicate or unknown arguments, or an unreadable changed-files file | unhappy | Exit 64 with the message and the usage line; a valid call exits 0 or 1. | TP-0.17 |
| `ci.yml` feeds F-6 the head branch, the pull request's changed files and its merge-back labels | happy | As in F-6's wiring (A-7). | TP-0.19 |
| A checkout on Windows | happy | Text and shell scripts are LF, Windows scripts CRLF, binaries untouched; the index holds no CRLF text. | TP-0.18 |
| `pnpm check` on the skeleton | happy | Format, lint, type-check and unit tests pass. | TP-0.6 |
| ESLint 10 with its lint plugins (A-13) | happy | formatjs 8.1.1 and jsx-a11y 6.10.2 pinned; one peer rule (jsx-a11y); `pnpm install` prints no peer warning. | TP-0.20 |
| Web lint rules under ESLint 10 (A-12, A-13, A-18) | unhappy | A web fixture with one violation per configured rule (including malformed ICU): each rule reports, nothing crashes, `formatjs/enforce-id` isn't active. | TP-0.22 |
| Float conversions bypassing the money rule (A-15) | unhappy | `Number.parseFloat`, `globalThis.parseFloat`, `window.parseFloat`, unary `+` fail lint. | TP-0.4 |
| A workflow with a tag-pinned action or a `${{ }}` inside `run:` (A-17) | unhappy | TP-0.23 fails and names the file and job. | TP-0.23 |
| Root scripts (A-14) | happy | Every root script is in §2.2.2 with its exact command; S-0's are all present. | TP-0.21 |
| Strict TypeScript | unhappy | An unchecked index access fails type-check. | TP-0.7 |

- **Acceptance criteria:**
  1. `pnpm install && pnpm check` passes on a fresh clone.
  2. CI runs steps 1 to 3 on pull requests.
  3. The README has Layout, Prerequisites, Commands and Environments sections.
  4. The PR proposes CLAUDE.md's "Project conventions" text (D-34, A-13) as a separate file `docs/proposals/claude-md-conventions.md` for the user. It isn't written into CLAUDE.md.

### S-1: Shared money, time and ID library (US-8)
- **Depends on:** S-0
- **Functions:** F-300 to F-306, F-310 to F-313.
- **Scenarios:**

- **Also (A-35):** adds `@vitest/coverage-v8`, the root `test:coverage` script, its place in `check`, and the CI step.
- **Acceptance criteria:** the library has no I/O. 100% of the branches in `money/` are covered by TP-1.x, enforced by `pnpm test:coverage` (A-35, TP-1.15).

### S-2: Configuration, database, schema step, local stack and test tooling (US-5, US-2, US-7 development)
- **Also (A-81, A-83, A-85):** F-26 `describeFailure`, `devMigrate.ts`, the README sections.
- **Also (A-43):** F-24 `buildServer` and the server `build` script, F-25 `serverRoot` (TP-2.6, TP-2.27, TP-2.28).
- **Also (A-30, A-31):** creates `apps/server/tsconfig.json` and extends root `typecheck`; adds `pnpm test:int` to `ci.yml`'s `check` job (TP-2.25, TP-2.26).
- **Depends on:** S-1
- **Functions:** F-7, F-10 to F-23 (including F-20 `seedDevelopmentDatabase`, A-14; F-19 in its S-2 shape, A-49; the `Logger` interface only, A-51), F-90 to F-92 (start-up and config handling only), F-94, F-95, F-96 (base members), §3 tables, `infra/compose.yaml`, test tooling (§10.1); root scripts `dev`, `db:reset`, `db:seed`, `db:migrate` (§2.2.2, A-14).
- **Scenarios:**

| Scenario | Happy / unhappy | Expected | Tests |
| -------- | --------------- | -------- | ----- |
| Valid configuration per process kind | happy | A frozen `Config`; secrets wrapped. | TP-2.1 |
| Missing or invalid variables | unhappy | `ConfigError` with names only; values never printed; exit 78. | TP-2.2, TP-2.6 |
| Production-only rules | unhappy | Each forbidden combination is reported. | TP-2.3 |
| OAuth redirect origin | happy and unhappy | As in §4.2. | TP-2.21 |
| Email and Google sign-in configuration, recovery-code key ring (A-2, A-3) | happy and unhappy | As in §4.2. | TP-2.22, TP-2.23 |

| Transactions: commit, rollback, serialisation retry | happy and unhappy | As in F-13. | TP-2.8 |
| Cluster bootstrap twice | happy | Idempotent. | TP-2.9 |
| Roles and passwords; invalid verifier; password form in production | happy and unhappy | As in F-15. | TP-2.10 |
| Grants: app vs capture; missing entry; credential table granted to capture | happy and unhappy | As in F-16. | TP-2.11 |
| Push onto an empty database; non-empty target | happy and unhappy | Tables created, `rate_limit_counters` UNLOGGED; `PushTargetNotEmptyError`. | TP-2.12 |
| Committed migrations; an unknown recorded migration | happy and unhappy | Applied; `UnknownMigrationError`. | TP-2.13 |

- **Also (A-61, A-70):** `images/postgres/Dockerfile` uses the test-setup `POSTGRES_IMAGE` reference exactly (TP-15.30); `compose.main.yaml`'s Mailpit uses `infra/compose.yaml`'s exact reference (TP-15.31).
- **Depends on:** S-5 to S-10, S-11b (the web image embeds the built SPA and `version.json`), S-14
- **Functions:** F-170, F-175, F-178, F-179, F-185, F-190, F-191; `images/*`; `infra/local/*`; root script `test:bats` (§2.2.2, A-14); runbook `infra/runbooks/stage0-laptop.md`. (`.gitattributes` moved to S-0, A-9.)
- **Scenarios:**

| Scenario | Happy / unhappy | Expected | Tests |
| -------- | --------------- | -------- | ----- |
| Postgres boot safeguards | unhappy and happy | As in F-170. | TP-15.1 |
| Peer login for `budmon_admin` | happy and unhappy | As in F-170. | TP-15.1b |
| Postgres logs don't leak | unhappy | No canary. | TP-15.2 |
| `pg_hba` rules on the laptop | happy and unhappy | As in F-175. | TP-15.3 |
| SCRAM verifiers accepted by Postgres | happy | As in F-190. | TP-15.11 |
| Local secret files; unfilled placeholders refuse start-up | happy and unhappy | As in F-191, F-11. | TP-15.23, TP-15.25 |
| Caddy on the laptop | happy and unhappy | As in F-175. | TP-15.13 |
| `budmon-local install` (ownership, `site.env`, placeholder stop, permission probe), `upgrade` from release copies, rollback, `restore` with the dump's release | happy and unhappy | As in F-178. | TP-15.20 to TP-15.22 |
| `secret set` writes with the container's owner and mode | happy and unhappy | As in F-178. | TP-15.28 |
| Mailpit in the laptop stack, quiet and unlogged (A-2) | happy | As in F-175. | TP-15.27, TP-16.13 |
| `bootstrap-owner` wrapper runs inside the running `api` container (A-6) | happy and unhappy | As in F-178. | TP-15.29 |
| Google callback's query string never logged (A-4) | unhappy | As in §5.3, F-175. | TP-15.13 |
| The laptop's Compose environment is a valid production configuration for every service | happy and unhappy | As in F-175. | TP-15.27 |
| Google Cloud bootstrap is idempotent | happy | As in F-179. | TP-15.26 |
| Static validation (shellcheck, bats, `compose config`) | unhappy | CI fails on errors. | TP-15.16 |
| First install, phone over Tailscale, Gmail connected from the laptop browser, a Sentry e-mail | happy | Manual acceptance. | TP-15.17, TP-15.18 |

- **Acceptance criteria:**
  1. AC-15.1: `infra/runbooks/stage0-laptop.md` covers every step listed in the file plan, in order, and the owner completes it on the laptop. Budmon then answers at `https://<laptop>.<tailnet>.ts.net` from the laptop and from the phone (at home and on mobile data).
  2. AC-15.2: the owner connects Gmail from the laptop's browser through the `http://localhost:8080` redirect (A-16). This needs `sources`; until then, AC-15.2 is "the OAuth client exists with that redirect URI".
  3. AC-15.3: with the laptop asleep, the Android app (`stage0` release build, F-264) records an entry offline, and it syncs after the laptop wakes (TP-15.17).
  4. AC-15.4: a deliberate test error (`cli diagnostics:sentry-test --yes`, F-93) arrives as a Sentry e-mail (TP-15.18).

### S-16: Release rehearsal (stage-0 shape) (D-41)
- **Depends on:** S-15, S-11b, S-13
- **Functions:** F-193 (A-24), F-194 to F-198 (F-198 already delivered in S-3), `.github/workflows/rehearsal.yml`.
- **Scenarios:**

| Scenario | Happy / unhappy | Expected | Tests |
| -------- | --------------- | -------- | ----- |
| Fake Google modes; sign-in token, `id_token` and JWKS (A-24) | happy and unhappy | As in F-196. | TP-16.2 |
| Harness step order, stop on failure | happy and unhappy | As in F-195. | TP-16.3 |
| Full rehearsal on a release candidate | happy | All steps green. | TP-16.4 |
| Canary flows (platform) | unhappy | No canary anywhere. | TP-16.5 |
| Stage setting or cross-role mount injected | unhappy | Steps 9 and 10 fail. | TP-16.6 |
| worker-capture can't reach Postgres except through `capture-db` | unhappy | Step 10 passes only when the connection fails. | TP-16.7 |
| Gate commands, including the migrator's previous-password fallback | happy | Step 11 green. | TP-16.12 |
| Mailpit quiet; bootstrap-owner and email tokens absent from all logs (A-2, A-6, A-25) | unhappy | Steps 7a, 7b, 8 and 8b green; sub-steps skipped before identity. | TP-16.13 |
| Google sign-in sub-step (A-24) | unhappy | Step 7c: `GOOGLE_ACCOUNT_UNKNOWN`; its values absent from all logs; skipped before identity. | TP-16.14 |
| 7c's `X-Budmon-Client: web/<n>` header and its build number (A-33) | happy and unhappy | As in F-195 7c. | TP-16.16 |
| Needle scan (A-24) | unhappy | As in F-193. | TP-16.15 |

- **Acceptance criteria:** the rehearsal passes for the first release candidate. `budmon-local upgrade` on the laptop builds the same tag the rehearsal ran, from the same inputs (Dockerfiles, pinned base digests, frozen lockfile); the images aren't necessarily byte-identical to CI's, which stage 1 removes by deploying the CI-built images.

## 10. Test plan

### 10.1 Tooling

The repository has no test tooling yet. The test-architect sets it up in S-0 to S-2 as follows.

- **Runner:** Vitest 5 (`vitest` 5.0.3, TypeScript 5.9.3, §2.4) with a root **`vitest.config.ts`** that declares the projects below through `test.projects` and sets `test.passWithNoTests: true` (several projects have no tests until their slice). Vitest 4 removed workspace files and 5.0.3 throws on them, so no `vitest.workspace.*` file exists (A-8). Projects are added as their slices create them: `shared`, `contract`, `server-unit`, `server-int` and `tools` in S-0; `server-int`'s `globalSetup` in S-2; `web-unit` in S-11a. `tools` sets `testTimeout: 60000` (its tests start ESLint and `tsc` programs).

  | Project | Environment | Includes |
  | ------- | ----------- | -------- |
  | `shared` | node | `packages/shared/test/**/*.test.ts` |
  | `contract` | node | `packages/contract/test/**/*.test.ts` |
  | `server-unit` | node | `apps/server/test/unit/**/*.test.ts` |
  | `server-int` | node, `globalSetup` | `apps/server/test/integration/**/*.test.ts`, `apps/server/test/privacy/**/*.test.ts` (A-102) |
  | `web-unit` | jsdom, `@solidjs/testing-library`, MSW | `apps/web/test/**/*.test.tsx?` |
  | `tools` | node | `tools/*/test/**/*.test.ts`, `infra/budmonctl/test/**/*.test.ts`, `packages/config/test/**/*.test.ts`, `packages/test-support/test/**/*.test.ts` (A-102) |
- **Scripts** (exact commands and owning slices in §2.2.2, A-14): root `pnpm test` runs all projects except `server-int`. `pnpm test:int` runs `server-int`. `pnpm test:e2e` runs Playwright (S-11b). `pnpm test:bats` runs the bats suites (S-15). `pnpm check` = format + lint + typecheck + `test` + `test:int`; `pnpm check:all` = `check` + `test:e2e` (S-11b) + Android `./gradlew check` (S-13).
- **Integration database** (`apps/server/test/setup/globalSetup.ts`):
  1. Start `POSTGRES_IMAGE` from `apps/server/test/setup/postgresImage.ts` (`postgres:18@sha256:<64 hex>`; S-15's `images/postgres` base uses the same reference, checked by TP-15.30, A-61) with Testcontainers and the command `postgres -c shared_preload_libraries=pg_stat_statements -c pg_stat_statements.track_utility=off`, or use `TEST_DATABASE_URL` (a superuser URL) if set.
  2. `bootstrapCluster` (F-14), then `runSchemaStep` into database `budmon_template` with `jobRegistry` = `createJobRegistry([...buildJobRegistry().all(), ...testJobDefinitions])` (A-202), with mode `push`, or `migrate` when `BUDMON_SCHEMA_MODE=migrate` (CI sets it on `release/*` and `hotfix/*`), using test role passwords.
  3. Each test file gets `CREATE DATABASE t_<random> TEMPLATE budmon_template` and connects as **`budmon_app`** (or `budmon_capture` / `budmon_queue` where the test needs it) through `createTestDatabase(role)`.
  4. `resetBetweenTests(db)` truncates every `public` table except `currencies`, and runs `DELETE FROM pgboss.job` as `budmon_queue`.
- **Helpers** (`apps/server/test/support/`):
  - factories per table in `test/factories/`;
  - `fixedClock` (F-310), `sequentialIds()`;
  - `fakeKmsClient()`, `fakeFetch(routes)`;
  - `createMemoryObjectStore` (F-143), `createMemoryErrorReporter` (F-34);
  - `inMemoryTelemetry()` (an InMemorySpanExporter and metric reader);
  - `logCapture()` (a pino destination collecting lines);
  - `buildApiContainer(overrides)` and `buildWorkerContainer(overrides)` (F-96);
  - `testPrincipal(overrides?: Partial<Principal>): Principal` (A-1), defaulting to `{ userId: <fixed UUIDv7>, isOwner: false, sessionId: <fixed UUIDv7> }`; every fixture or fake auth hook that builds a `Principal` uses it;
  - `injectJson(app, method, url, body?, headers?)` around Fastify's `inject`.
- **Privacy canary suite** (`apps/server/test/privacy/`): `CANARIES` from F-198. Each flow puts canaries into every sensitive field, captures logs, spans, metrics, `ErrorReporter` events and `pgboss.job.output`, and asserts `scanForCanaries` finds nothing. Platform flows: TP-3.10, TP-4.9, TP-5.2, TP-6.7, TP-8.12, TP-9.11. Modules add flows in their LLDs.
- **Playwright** (`apps/web/e2e/`):
  - `webServer` runs `pnpm --filter @budmon/server e2e:serve`, which starts Testcontainers Postgres, the schema step, seeders, API and worker, then serves `vite preview` built with `VITE_FIXTURES=1 VITE_PSEUDO_LOCALES=1`.
  - The fixture `withAxe` runs `@axe-core/playwright` after each test and attaches the JSON report. It never fails the test (D-39).
  - Projects: `chromium` (PRs); `firefox` and `webkit` (release candidates); `pseudo-rtl` (locale `ar-XB`, PRs); `perf` (release candidates, Chromium, CPU throttling 4× through CDP `Emulation.setCPUThrottlingRate`).
- **Android:** JUnit 4 + Robolectric 4.17 + MockK + Turbine. Room in-memory database. OkHttp `MockWebServer`. Compose UI tests (`createComposeRule`) with `LocalLayoutDirection provides LayoutDirection.Rtl` variants and `fontScale = 2f`. Shared vectors through the test resources source dir. `./gradlew testDebugUnitTest lint ktlintCheck`; `connectedDebugAndroidTest` on release candidates (emulator API 34).
- **Bash:** `infra/local/test/setup-bats.sh` clones, into `.tools/bats/` (git-ignored), exactly these commits (verified upstream with `git ls-remote` on 2026-10-07): `bats-core` v1.12.0 → `713504bc0224a19b3d7c7958c18dc07f64f54b44`; `bats-support` v0.3.0 → `24a72e14349690bcbf7c151b9d2d1cdd32d36eb1`; `bats-assert` v2.1.0 → `78fa631d1370562d2cd4a1390989e706158e7bf0`. After `git checkout <tag>` it compares `git rev-parse HEAD` with the pinned SHA and exits 1 on a mismatch (a moved tag is refused). The cloud environment and CI have no bats installed, so S-15 adds this script and `pnpm test:bats` runs it first. Tests live in `infra/local/test/*.bats`, with stub `git`, `docker`, `pg_dump`, `pg_restore`, `gcloud`, `openssl` and `curl` on `PATH` recording calls. shellcheck on every script.
- **What the build environment can and can't test.** The agents build in a Linux cloud environment and on GitHub-hosted runners. Reports from the build state which of these a slice's results rest on.
  - **Testable there:** unit and integration tests against real Postgres (Testcontainers) and MinIO; the laptop's Compose topology (both projects, `capture-db`, TLS `verify-full`, per-UID secret ownership, `pg_hba`, Caddy on `127.0.0.1:8080`); the Postgres image's boot safeguards; the rehearsal harness and the full stage-0 rehearsal; `budmon-local` through bats with stubs plus the integration parts of TP-15.22 against real Docker and Postgres; `gcp-bootstrap.sh` with a stub `gcloud`; Playwright on Chromium.
  - **Not testable there (checked by the owner, or indicative only):** anything on Windows (WSL2 networking and localhost forwarding, Docker Desktop's bind-mount ownership and port publishing, `.wslconfig`, Android Studio); the Android SDK, emulator and Gradle release builds unless the CI job provides them (`android` job only); real Google Cloud KMS, Pub/Sub, Gmail and OAuth, Backblaze B2, Tailscale and Sentry; behaviour that exists only on GitHub Actions (workflow triggers, `GITHUB_TOKEN` permissions, tag pushes), which is checked by actionlint and structure tests and then observed on the first real release; Playwright Firefox and WebKit and the CPU-throttled performance runs, whose results in this environment are indicative only. The WSL2-to-emulator development path (`http://10.0.2.2:5173/` reaching the development API through Vite and WSL2's localhost forwarding) is in this group too. The manual acceptance cases (TP-15.17, TP-15.18) and AC-15.1 to AC-15.4 cover the first group on the laptop.
- **CI jobs** (`ci.yml`):

  | Job | Steps (D-27) | Runs |
  | --- | ------------ | ---- |
  | `check` | 1 to 4, including `server-int`: S-0's step runs `format:check`, `lint`, `typecheck` and `test`; **S-1 adds `pnpm test:coverage` after `pnpm test`** (A-35); **S-2 adds `pnpm test:int` after `pnpm test`** (A-31) | Every PR |
  | `contract` | Drift, `oasdiff` against main, F-8, F-348 | Every PR |
  | `e2e` | 5 | Every PR |
  | `android` | 6 | Path filter, release candidates |
  | `infra-lint` | TP-15.16, bats | Changes to `infra/`, `images/`, `.github/` |
  | `migrations` | F-6 + report, or checks (i), (iii), (iv) | Pull requests only. The F-6 step (S-0, A-7) runs on every PR; the branch-type steps arrive in S-14 |
  | `rehearsal` | `rehearsal.yml` (stage-0 shape, F-195) | `release/*` and `hotfix/*` PRs |
  | `dev-smoke` | TP-2.18; TP-4.23 from S-4 (A-55) | `main` only |

### 10.2 Cases

Types: **U** unit, **I** integration (real Postgres and/or HTTP in-process), **E** end-to-end (Playwright, emulator, or the rehearsal), **S** static/CI check. "Vectors" means the shared test-vector files.

| TP-16.5 | S-16 | E | canary flows | rehearsal stack | Flows: a request whose body fails validation with a canary in a field; malformed JSON containing a canary; an FX backfill failing because fake FX returns 500 with a canary body; a `GET` with a canary in the query string | Scan finds no canary in any source listed in F-195 step 8 (capture-path flows are added by `sources`) |
| TP-16.6 | S-16 | E | steps 9, 10 | rehearsal with a doctored overlay adding `INFRA_STAGE=0` to `api`; another mounting capture secrets into `api` | Run | Step 9 fails; step 10 fails |

**Resolved:**

| # | Question | Resolution | Where |
| - | -------- | ---------- | ----- |
| Q-1 | FX before 2024-03-02, the fallback provider's data floor (`FX_FALLBACK_FIRST_DATE`). | **(a) "No rate"** (user go-ahead on the recommended default, 2026-10-07; HLD §11). A conversion dated before 2024-03-02 with no stored day returns `{ no_rate, reason: "no_day" }` and enqueues no backfill, as F-132 already specifies (TP-9.5). Extendable later by an amendment, for example an Open Exchange Rates historical backfill if its free plan allows it. | F-132 |

**Open:**

| # | Question | Options | Facts | Blocks |
| - | -------- | ------- | ----- | ------ |
| Q-2 | **An owner approval click on every release** (v0.5's `tag-approval` on the release path). | (a) Keep it in the stage-1 chain. (b) Approval for hotfix tags only. | Stage 0 has no signing and no deployment from CI; `tag.yml` tags with `GITHUB_TOKEN` and `budmon-local upgrade` is run by the owner by hand, which is the approval in stage 0. HLD §11 Q-2 records it as deferred. | **Deferred to the stage-1 LLD.** It doesn't block this LLD's approval and is listed here only so it isn't lost. |
